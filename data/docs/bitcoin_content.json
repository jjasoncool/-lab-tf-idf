  "content": " SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — As bitcoin reached historic highs, surpassing $100,000 for the first tim e, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele was triumphant on Thursday about his big bet on the cryptocurrency.The adoption of bitcoin — which has been legal tender in the Central American nation since 2021 — never quite matched the president’s enthusiasm, but the value of the government’s reported investment now stands at more than $600 million.Bitcoin has rallied mightily since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, exceeding the $100,000 mark on Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Just two years ago, bitcoin’s volatile value fell below $17,000. Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting just above $99,000 by 3 p.m. E.T.Bukele on Thursday blamed his beleaguered political opposition for causing many Salvadorans to miss out on the bonanza.FILE - A bitcoin symbol is presented on an LED screen during the closing ceremony of a congress for cryptocurrency investors in Santa Maria Mizata, El Salvador, Nov. 20, 2021.

(AP Photo/Salvador Melendez, File)Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS/Salvador MelendezThere were street protests when the Congress made bitcoin legal tender in June 2021, though that move was not the only motivation for the protesters.The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador’s unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home. The government offered $30 in bitcoin to those who signed up for digital wallets.Many did so, but quickly cashed out the cryptocurrency.“It’s important to emphasize that not only did the opposition err resoundingly with bitcoin, but rather, differently from other issues (where they have also been wrong), this time their opposition affected many,” Bukele wrote on Facebook.Bukele drew an “impressive” comment from Elon Musk on the social media platform X Thursday.El Salvador’s former Central Bank President Carlos Acevedo pointed out on Thursday that while there has been a gain, it remains an unrealized one until the government’s bitcoin is sold. That said, he credited Bukele’s administration with doing well on the bitcoin move, especially in light of Trump’s election.Acevedo said “the markets’ optimism that a Trump administration will be friendly with the markets and particularly with bitcoin” explained its sustained rally over the past month.But the cryptocurrency’s volatility was a persistent risk, he said.“The average Salvadoran doesn’t use bitcoin, but obviously there are Salvadorans with economic resources who even before had already invested in bitcoin, but it is a small group,” Acevedo said.Esteban Escamilla, a worker in a clothing store in Santa Tecla, outside the capital San Salvador, said he had cashed out the original $30 of bitcoin offered in 2021. “I don’t use bitcoin because I don’t have (money) to invest and speculate with, but I know it has gone up a lot,” he said, recognizing that he would have more money now if he had kept it in bitcoin.Josefa Torres, 45, said as she was doing her grocery shopping that she didn’t have any bitcoin either. “I took out the money and used it for household expenses,” she said.At the conclusion of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and El Salvador’s government in August, the IMF issued a statement that mentioned the country’s bitcoin holdings.“While many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project,” the IMf said.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

  "content": "The price of bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, soaring to a fresh high as the world's largest cryptocurrency extended a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump.Bitcoin has climbed more than 40% since Election Day, when voters opted for a candidate viewed as friendly toward digital currency.Those gains have far outpaced the stock market. The S&P 500 has increased about 2.4% over that period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped 2.6%.On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.Trump said he would replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom many crypto proponents dislike for what they perceive as a robust approach to crypto regulation.FILE - Bitcoin logos are displayed at the Inside Bitcoins conference and trade show on April 7, 2014, in New York. Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark.AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, FileGensler announced that he plans to resign on Jan. 20, 2025, the date of Trump's inauguration.The post-election euphoria has lifted other parts of the crypto sector. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has climbed 27%. Lesser-known dogecoin has skyrocketed about 140%, while litecoin has surged 35%.Shares of Coinbase, a top crypto trading platform, have increased more than 70% since Trump's reelection.The growth in recent weeks extends a remarkable turnabout for the once-beleaguered crypto industry. The sector entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.FTX, a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed in November 2022. The implosion set off a 17-month legal saga that resulted in the conviction of Bankman-Fried for fraud. In April, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in April after pleading guilty to charges that his platform had enabled illicit financial activity.The reelection of Trump marks the latest in a series of positive developments that have buoyed cryptocurrency this year.Those gains have been propelled, in part, by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.Last month, options on BlackRock's popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were made available for trading on the Nasdaq. The options, which provide a new avenue for bitcoin investors, allow individuals to commit to buy or sell the ETF at a given price by a specific date. While such investments typically come with additional risk, they can also make large payouts.IBIT inched upward 1% on Friday, reaching a record high of about $56.Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, attributed the recent crypto surge to investors' anticipation of friendly policy under Trump, as well as the newly available options trading for bitcoin ETFs.Still, the performance of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, has proven volatile, Armour added. The price of bitcoin could fall, especially if Trump encounters difficulty following through on his campaign commitments, he said.\"As long as the narrative stays positive, there's always room to grow,\" Armour told ABC News before bitcoin reached $100,000. \"I also think campaign promises don't always come to fruition.\"\"It's still a highly volatile asset,\" Armour added.Copyright © 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures."

  "title": "Memecoins Reach $140B Market Cap and Gain Ground in Crypto Economy",
  "content": "The memecoin sector was worth 11.21% of crypto market capitalization, excluding bitcoin and ether, as of Dec. 1. Dec 5, 2024, 9:25 p.m. UTCMemecoins undoubtedly capture a big slice of crypto observers' attention — even if not everyone is a fan. But data shows they're gobbling up a growing amount of the crypto economy too.The sector — powered by the likes of dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) — made up 3.16% of the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on Dec. 1, up from 1.3% at the beginning of the year, according to a new report from crypto exchange CEX.IO. If you exclude crypto titans bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), memecoin market share jumps to 11.21% from 4.2%.That equates to big dollars: more than $140 billion of market value, per CoinGecko data, stashed in cryptocurrencies that don't pretend to have any utility. Extremely volatile by nature, they tend to be named after animals, viral internet jokes and political figures or events.As bitcoin topples the $100,000 threshold for the first time, memecoins are also rocketing higher. Dogecoin has soared 168% since Donald Trump's election spurred throughout the crypto market. Dogecoin is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $64 billion, according to CoinDesk data.The question is whether this is just how things work in the early stages of a bull market these days, or a harbinger that things have gotten overheated.\"In previous cycles, memecoins typically experienced their largest capital rotation toward the end of the post-halving bull run,\" Alexandr Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, told CoinDesk in an email.\"Halving\" refers to the once-every-four-years event — the most recent one was early in 2014 — when the reward for mining bitcoin gets slashed by 50%, which often correlates with crypto gains.\"However, this cycle stands out due to the significant rise in memecoin influence occurring well before the halving, and persisting even during bitcoin’s consolidation mid-year,\" Kerya added.The oldest memecoin, dogecoin, was created as a joke in 2013 and gained significant attention during the bull market that ended in 2021 as Tesla CEO Elon Musk repeatedly posted about it on social media. Other dog-themed coins, like SHIB, rode on DOGE's coat-tails and reached billions of dollars of valuation. Over time, memecoins came to be considered as a crypto investment category in their own right, in the same vein as decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, artificial intelligence tokens or privacy coins.\"While memecoins may eventually reach a plateau, similar to DeFi, the market is still in the process of determining where that equilibrium will be established,\" Kerya wrote.Eating up market shareThe memecoin sector underwent explosive growth early this year, the report said, when the daily number of projects deployed on Pump.fun — a Solana-based crypto project that makes it easy for users to launch tokens — went from a few dozen a day in February to thousands per day in March. Nowadays, over 60,000 memecoins are created daily, half of them through Pump.fun, the report said.As a sector, memecoins saw a 330% increase in their combined market capitalization over the period from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1, the report said. For comparison, bitcoin is up 140% since the beginning of the year, while ether is up 71%. Memecoin trading volume grew 979% in the same period, and now accounts for 5.27% of the entire crypto market's volume. Furthermore, memecoins retained significant volume in June while other sectors of the crypto economy saw declines.\"As a gateway for new investors, the growth of memecoins highlights the increasing influence of retail-driven narratives in the crypto market. As a sentiment bet, it reflects market optimism and the anticipation of a continuation of the post-halving rally,\" Kerya wrote. \"However, with increased share of memecoins, it also highlights the potential for the faster appearance of speculative bubbles. While this could amplify the intensity of a bull run, it might also shorten its duration.\"The memecoin sector has changed over the years. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu dominated trading volume and market capitalization in 2021. In contrast, 2024 has seen a wide variety of newer memecoins — such as dogwifhat (WIF), Brett (BRETT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Popcat (POPCAT) — crack (or come close to) the top 100 coins by market cap.And whereas the majority of the largest memecoins were dog-themed up until March, cat-themed and AI-themed tokens have been stealing market share from dog tokens. Political memecoins also fared well into the U.S. election in November, after which they saw an 80% drop in trading volume.Memecoin performance by category (Credit: CEX.IO) The networks on which trading activity occurs have also shifted. Dogecoin has its own proof-of-work blockchain, which mimics the Bitcoin network's. Ethereum-based memecoins such as pepe (PEPE) and MAGA (TRUMP) have also seen some popularity. But Solana, thanks to Pump.fun, is the big winner of the memecoin craze in 2024; the network accounts for 30% of the sector’s trading volume, and 15% of memecoin market cap is based on it.However, Telegram’s TON network’s memecoin trading volume grew 750 times in the last six months, even though the blockchain still only accounts for 1% of the total memecoin market cap.\"Given memecoins' ability to boost retail involvement and revenue generation for DeFi platforms, 2025 could see stronger integrations between launchpads and decentralized exchanges to capitalize on this trend,\" Kerya wrote. \"However, in ecosystems like Solana, heavy reliance on memecoins has raised concerns and could eventually backfire, straining its broader development.\"Tom CarrerasTom was sucked into crypto in 2020 and is very much enjoying the ride.

The Dow shed more than half a percent; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each lost about two-tenths of a percent. The declines come just one day after all three indexes notched record closing highs. Patrick Kennedy, founding partner of All Source Investment Management, believes now is the time for stock market investors to take a bit of a breather. \"So, when it comes to market valuations, we think things look a little frothy right now, especially with, you know, the S&P trading at 23 times next year's numbers. [FLASH] There's still a lot of opportunity underneath the surface, in our opinion. We happen to like software, we like biotech and we like cybersecurity. Right now, those are the three big sectors we want to see our managers be exposed to. But other than that, at the index level, we think this is a good time to take a look at a pause.\" Among individual movers, shares of UnitedHealth Group dropped more than 5% and were the biggest weight on the Dow and S&P 500. Shares of Cigna and Molina Healthcare also fell. Health insurance companies are reassessing the risks for their top executives the day after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan. UnitedHealthcare is part of UnitedHealth Group. Shares of Synopsys fell more than 12% after the chip design software firm forecast fiscal 2025 revenue below Wall Street expectations, in part due to a slump in China sales. And cryptocurrency and blockchain-related stocks lost steam after bitcoin fell below the $100,000 level after eclipsing it for the first time ever earlier in the day. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, ended down nearly 5%. Investors now turn their attention to Friday's monthly nonfarm payrolls report for clues on the Federal Reserve's next policy moves."

  "title": "Cryptocurrency Assets Make Up Small Part of 401 ( k ) Market , GAO Finds",
  "content": " Amid growing concerns from the Employee Benefits Security Administration and other industry experts about the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency assets, the Government Accountability Office recently investigated the prevalence of crypto assets in the 401(k) market.The GAO found that crypto only encompasses a small part of the 401(k) market, as of mid-2023, but the limited amount of data provided by the Department of Labor poses a barrier to fully measuring the scope of its prevalence in 401(k) plans. The report was commissioned by Representative Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, the ranking member of the House Committee on Ways and Means.In its report, the GAO identified 69 crypto asset investment options available to 401(k) participants either through their core investment options or self-directed brokerage windows. EBSA officials told the GAO that no matter how crypto asset investment options are marketed, fiduciaries are responsible for determining whether such options should be included in their plan’s core investment lineup or should be offered through a separate arrangement.Recordkeepers surveyed by the GAO between July and September 2023 reported that none of the plans they served offered crypto investment options in their core lineups and reported minimal participant investment in crypto investments through self-directed brokerage windows. The investment amounted to substantially less than 1% of the 401(k) market, whether measured by plans, participants or assets.In its analysis of investment returns, the GAO found that crypto assets have uniquely high volatility and that their returns can come with “considerable risk.” The GAO’s simulation found that a high allocation—20%—to bitcoin, the crypto asset with the longest price history, can lead to higher volatility than smaller allocations.Cryptocurrency’s Encouraging FutureOn Thursday, bitcoin traded higher than $100,000 for the first time, fueled by investors predicting that President-elect Donald Trump will cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. This milestone also coincided with Trump’s nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been a critic of the crypto industry.The total value of the crypto market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record of more than $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko.DOL guidance currently states that the fiduciary responsibility to be prudent in selecting and monitoring 401(k) plans’ core investment options does not change when crypto assets are offered. DOL officials told the GAO they generally have not required fiduciaries to select and monitor all options offered outside the core menu, such as through self-directed brokerage windows, in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act standards.As a result, participants who invest outside the core menu have to take primary responsibility for selecting and monitoring crypto asset investment options.Data Collection Can Be ImprovedIndustry data from a 2021 report on self-directed brokerage windows indicated that between 15% and 20% of defined contribution plans restrict self-directed brokerage window offerings to mutual funds, but the GAO argued that this does not fully restrict access to crypto investments, as three of the 69 crypto investment options identified by the GAO were mutual funds.Overall, the GAO found that the DOL does not collect comprehensive data to identify 401(k) plans that give participants access to crypto assets. For example, the Form 5500s that plan fiduciaries file do not identify crypto asset investment options in plans with fewer than 100 participants. In 2022, 88% of 401(k) plans had fewer than 100 participants.In addition, plans with at least 100 participants aggregate self-directed brokerage window investments, making it more difficult for the DOL to isolate investments in crypto assets.In prior work, the GAO recommended that the DOL should consider revisions to the Form 5500 series that would provide more transparency and detail into plan investments, among other things. The DOL has taken some steps to improve Form 5500 reporting, but according to the GAO, its recommendation has not been fully implemented.The GAO also recommended that Congress should consider legislation to fill gaps in federal regulatory oversight of crypto assets. For example, one bill introduced seeks to address issues such as the comingling of customer funds with institutional funds by crypto-asset trading platforms. However, none of these bills have become law.The GAO provided a draft of its report to the DOL, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for review and comment. "

  "title": "Stock market today : Wall Street edges back from its records as bitcoin briefly pops above $100 , 000",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — The huge rally for U.S. stocks lost momentum on Thursday as Wall Street counted down to a big jobs report that’s coming on Friday. The crypto market had more action, and bitcoin briefly burst to a record above $103,000 before pulling back.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from the all-time high it had set the day before, its 56th of the year so far, to shave a bit off what’s set to be one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before.Bitcoin powered above $100,000 for the first time the night before, after President-elect Donald Trump chose Paul Atkins, who's seen as a crypto advocate, as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk. Sharp swings for bitcoin are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride. After rising as much as 9% in early trading, MicroStrategy, a company that’s been raising cash just to buy bitcoin, swung to a loss of 4.8%. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global fell 3.1% after likewise erasing a big early gain.Elsewhere on Wall Street, stocks of airlines helped lead the way following the latest bumps up to financial forecasts from carriers.American Airlines Group soared 16.8% after saying it’s making more in revenue during the last three months of 2024 than it expected, and it will likely make a bigger profit than it had earlier forecast. The airline also chose Citi to be its exclusive partner for credit cards that give miles in its loyalty program. That should help its cash coming in from co-branded credit card and other partners grow by about 10% annually.Southwest Airlines climbed 2% after saying it’s seeing stronger demand from leisure travelers than it expected. It also raised its forecast for revenue for the holiday traveling season.On the losing end of Wall Street was Synposys, which tumbled 12.4%. The supplier for the semiconductor industry reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it also warned of “continued macro uncertainties” and gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.American Eagle Outfitters fell even more, 14.3%, after the retailer said it’s preparing for “potential choppiness” outside of peak selling periods. It was reminiscent of a warning from Foot Locker earlier in the week and raised more concerns about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain.Solid spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has avoided a recession that earlier seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market. This week’s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels.Expectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.17% from 4.18% late Wednesday.The S&P 500 fell 11.38 points to 6,075.11. The Dow sank 248.33 to 44,765.71, and the Nasdaq composite lost 34.86 to 19,700.26.In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly calm in Europe after far-right and left-wing lawmakers in France joined together to vote on a no-confidence motion that will force Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign. The CAC 40 index in Paris added 0.4%.In South Korea, the Kospi fell 0.9% to compound its 1.4% decline from the day before. President Yoon Suk Yeol was facing possible impeachment after he suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night. He revoked the martial law declaration six hours later.Crude oil prices slipped after eight members of the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries decided to put off increasing oil production.AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Leon Millholland.Sandy Springs police received reports of hundreds of people defrauded through crypto scams in 2024. The average loss is around $10,000. But they have investigated cases involving hundreds of thousands of dollars.“Nationwide, it’s around 65 million,” said Millholland.This week, Sandy Springs City Council approved a resolution giving police authority to regulate BMTs and ATMs not licensed by a state agency. Businesses that have transaction machines will be required to post a sign advising customers that law enforcement doesn’t accept payment with cryptocurrency.TRENDING STORIES:“Before they send cryptocurrency or us currency, contact us and we will help verify whether it’s legit or not,” said Sgt. Millholland.Customers at a gas station with a BMT, say they are alarmed over the new scam targeting seniors.“I think it’s wrong, why are they doing that to older people? They need the money for their retirement. They don’t work anymore,” said customer Makala Williams.Businesses with BTMs will have to post the warning signs when renewing their business license or face a five hundred dollar fine.[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]"

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is stronger than the central bank had expected when it started cutting rates in September, and he appeared to signal support for a slower pace of reductions. Markets are pricing in about a 70% chance of a quarter-point cut in interest rates this month.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 rose 0.4% for its sixth straight day of wins. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.37% even as the country's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. OPEC+ extends oil supply cutThe OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations will postpone plans to roll back several formal and voluntary production cuts into 2026, according to delegate sources, who could only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks. Oil prices ticked up slightly on the news. An unlikely endorsement for bitcoin On Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $96,500. While the initial euphoria may have been triggered by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's planned nomination of Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that bitcoin is \"a competitor for gold\" also helped sentiment. [PRO] Bitcoin is the new gold?Gold has long held a place in investors' portfolios as an asset that hedged against market swings and geopolitical instability. Now bitcoin, with its meteoric rise in popularity and price especially in recent months, might take over the role gold plays, according to strategists. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

Sign up here for our weekly ETF Wrap. It's been a head-spinning week for exchange-traded-fund investors monitoring geopolitical risks to stocks in their portfolios. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Dec. 3, accusing his political opposition of sympathizing with North Korea and sparking a selloff in the country's stocks. Buying the drop in South Korean equities spurred by the martial-law declaration seems fine to Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research and author of \"Geopolitical Alpha: An Investment Framework for Predicting the Future.\" He said in a phone interview that \"geopolitical events rarely have staying power,\" adding that although it was a \"very big\" negative surprise that the president of South Korea effectively tried \"to do a coup against his own parliament,\" the move failed. Yoon's \"own party, right away, as it was happening, said it was unconstitutional,\" said Papic. \"The guy's done. They're calling for his impeachment.\" The iShares MSCI South Korea ETF EWY, Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF FLKR and Matthews Korea Active ETF MKOR all dropped on Dec. 3, ending the day sharply lower even after bouncing from the initial selloff early in the trading session, according to FactSet data. Shares of all three ETFs fell Thursday, deepening their losses this week and year to date. Still, South Korea's democracy demonstrated \"resiliency\" at a time when incumbent governments are being challenged globally, according to Papic. \"The response from both government and civil society\" showed South Korea's \"checks and balances and strength of institutions are strong,\" said Perth Tolle, founder of Life + Liberty Indexes, in an email to MarketWatch. Tolle's Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF FRDM - which tracks an index of emerging-market stocks based on personal- and economic-freedom metrics and excludes authoritarian regimes - currently has a 14% weight to South Korea. \"Our methodology results in higher exposure to countries with stronger institutions, rule of law, and checks and balances,\" said Tolle. South Korea provided \"a good test of all those things, and so far, the outcome appears consistent with their allocation in the FRDM index strategy,\" she said, referring to the ticker of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF. Shares of the fund are up 3.8% this week through Thursday, bringing its year-to-date gain to 5.2%, according to FactSet data. By contrast, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF has plunged more than 15% so far in 2024. Although South Korea is often categorized as an emerging market when it comes to investing indexes, that label is a \"borderline\" case, as the country's market is similar to Japan, said Jason Hsu, founder and chief investment officer of Rayliant Global Advisors, in a phone interview. The actively managed Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF RAYE has South Korean company Samsung Electronics Co. (KR:005930) in its portfolio as a core holding, said Hsu. Beyond making televisions, Samsung manufactures semiconductor components, he noted. Read: Samsung Electronics Rallies After $7 Billion Buyback Plan Shares of the Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF have climbed almost 10.7% this year through Thursday, FactSet data show. In Hsu's view, the sharp drop in South Korean stocks on Dec. 3, when markets \"freaked out and sold\" on the surprise declaration of martial law, presented a buying opportunity. The country changes presidents \"quite regularly,\" and when they exit, often they don't \"go quietly,\" he said. The president declaring martial law may have been just \"a slightly different spin on not wanting to leave\" after becoming unpopular, according to Hsu. But \"there was never any real risk that you got this military government coup,\" he said, because the South Korean president is \"democratically elected and doesn't control the military.\" French government collapses Meanwhile, the French government fell on Wednesday after lawmakers in France voted to oust Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The no-confidence vote left French President Emmanuel Macron needing to appoint a new prime minister. While the unfolding of events in South Korea seemed a bit \"comical\" to Papic, he said those in France are \"more serious.\" Investors might want to wait for the new government to be created before buying French stocks, as the situation will then be \"pretty much over no matter who comes to power,\" he said. Macron announced Thursday that he would stay in office until the end of his term and that he will name a new prime minister within days of the ousted Barnier's resignation, according to an Associated Press report. The iShares MSCI France ETF EWQ is up 1.2% this week through Thursday, but remains down in 2024 with a 6.3% decline year to date, FactSet data show. Stick with U.S. stocks? ETF investors clearly favored U.S. equities over international stocks last month, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas ETF research at State Street Global Advisors. He found that 97% of November's equity flows into U.S.-listed ETFs went into funds targeting U.S. stocks. \"Everyone was stockpiling U.S. exposures, given the strong market sentiment\" following the election of Donald Trump as president, as well as the country's stronger economy and stock market compared to the rest of the world, Bartolini said in a phone interview. Check out: How Treasury yields are driving whether U.S. stocks beat the rest of the world Strong momentum in the U.S. stock market is fueled in part by expected tax cuts under President-elect Trump, said Papic. That, along with the uncertainty surrounding tariffs under the incoming White House administration, makes it more difficult for people seeking to invest internationally over the next six months, according to his thinking. The \"powerful consensus view\" is more \"upside\" for U.S. equities, he said.

  "title": "Bitcoin zooms past $100 , 000 on Trump bump",
  "content": "Market participants expect this pro-crypto stance could drive global adoption, with countries like China lifting restrictions on personal crypto ownership, and Brazil and Russia exploring Bitcoin for reserves. Bitcoin zoomed past the $100,000 mark for the first time on Thursday, fuelled by growing optimism over a crypto-friendly regime under US President-elect Donald Trump and strong institutional inflows through Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The world’s largest cryptocurrency surged 6% to an all-time high of $103,800, following Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was last trading at around $102,850. Trump’s election victory has pered up investor interest in the crypto market, with Bitcoin’s price soaring 50% since his win, exactly a month ago. So far this year, Bitcoin has gained almost 150% buoyed by institutional confidence, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and increasing acceptance of digital assets, experts said. Govt open to alternative financing model for MSME exporters: Piyush Goyal ITC MAARS to connect 10 million farmers to markets in 5 years Audit firms yet to meet many norms: NFRA Vi plans to raise Rs 2K crore; may use funds to repay Indus debt Analysts predict the rally could push Bitcoin to $120,000 by end of the year and potentially surpass $150,000 in 2025. Global investment firm Bernstein has projected Bitcoin at $200,000 by 2025 and $1 million by 2033. “The re-election of Trump has reinvigorated enthusiasm within the crypto community, supported by a significant uptick in institutional investments,” said Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch. Based on historical post-halving trends, Bitcoin could reach a peak of around $150,000 in 2025, with the April 2024 halving leading to a rally of 300-400%, he said. Trump’s pledge to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve has further fuelled investor optimism, which is only expected to rise as he takes office in January. Market participants expect this pro-crypto stance could drive global adoption, with countries like China lifting restrictions on personal crypto ownership, and Brazil and Russia exploring Bitcoin for reserves. “Key developments, including Elon Musk heading the newly-established department of government efficiency, plans for a dedicated White House crypto policy role and Trump’s appointment of Atkins as SEC chair, have fuelled this remarkable rally towards this mark,” said Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex. “With Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and Atkins’ leadership, the market is bound for friendlier reforms and wider adoption, setting Bitcoin on track to reach $120,000 in the coming weeks,” he said. Other cryptocurrencies are also riding the wave. XRP, Binance Coin and Solana hit lifetime highs as investors flock to digital assets. Meanwhile, the success of Bitcoin ETFs has simplified access for institutional investors, with BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF now managing over 500,000 BTC, worth $48 billion. “The next year looks incredibly promising for crypto,” said Vishal Sacheendran, head of Regional Markets at Binance. “The industry is likely to see enhanced security measures, greater transparency, and improved accessibility for retail and institutional investors. Discussions around a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and corporate treasury integration signal a shift toward mainstream adoption.” Rahul Pagidipati, CEO at cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay, said, “Bitcoin is now effectively one of the top 10 most valued assets in the world, ranking above all commodities except gold and higher than most companies. The crypto market’s total capitalisation has also crossed the $3.5-trillion mark, demonstrating the scale of interest and widespread adoption in the space.”"

  "content": "Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,619. It last fetched $101,139, up about 3.2% on the day. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump said on Truth Social, his social media network, on Thursday. Don't miss out on what's happening!

This form is protected by reCAPTCHA. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital. “Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream – this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” Trump — who once labeled crypto a scam — embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. Bitcoin’s proponents cheered Trump’s nomination of Atkins to the SEC. A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to “develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,” and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. “Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. “We look forward to working with him … and ushering in — together — a new wave of American crypto innovation.” A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump’s promised crypto advisory council. PART OF THE LANDSCAPE Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. “Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. “Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalized,” he said. It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November. Software firm Microstrategy, which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Some say the asset remains a speculative or investment vehicle and not an instrument for payments. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likened bitcoin to gold, “only its virtual, its digital.” “People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. Its highly volatile, it’s not a competitor for the dollar.” While earlier big bitcoin rallies have been followed by significant pullbacks, its wider adoption now may help tamp down volatility, analysts said. “That is not to say that there will not be 30-50% drawdowns over time, but my base case is that the nature of the drawdowns will be less severe than what we saw in the last bear market,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said. “Passive flows into ETFs, a liquid options market, corporate treasury adoption, and nation state adoption will likely play a large role in dampening volatility,” Farrell said. ‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’ Cryptocurrencies have been criticized for their massive energy consumption and use in crime around the world, and the underlying technology is far from delivering a revolution in the way money moves around the globe. The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanctions and launder cash for drug traffickers. Although calculations vary, the Cambridge University Centre for Alternative Finance estimates bitcoin uses around the same amount of electricity each year as Poland or South Africa. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. “As time goes by it’s proving itself as part of the financial landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. “I find it very hard to value it … it’s anyone’s guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” "

  "title": "Crypto Glossary : A List of Top Terms to Know , From A - Z",
  "content": "Explainer A Crypto GlossaryFrom airdrops to yield farming, here’s a modest guide to the terms and jargon that separate the normies from the true believers.June 16, 2024, 12:01 AM UTCIn the beginning was the (made up) word: Bitcoin. And the words that came with it: Blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptocurrencies. Face it, while crypto’s arc of innovation touches many things — computer science, economics, finance — its biggest breakthrough may be its constant supply of fresh vernacular, a trend that shows no sign of depletion. Enemies are named (“TradFi”), propaganda unmasked (“FUD”) and battlefields defined (“web3”). Among crypto bulls, jargon is almost as big a currency as Bitcoin itself. Pseudoscientific language is traded online with virtually the same gusto as memecoins and NFTs. Some of the terms stick around, and some fade away. Here’s a selection of crypto slang worth knowing, whether you’ve got diamond hands or are just a normie. A airdropThink of getting free samples when you shop at a store. Crypto projects give tokens for free to users in exchange for their having taken actions that could be seen as assisting the idea, such as interacting with the code. Airdrops are also a way to build interest in new coins, since they are only valuable if they have a community of users – ideally, airdrop recipients have an incentive to promote interest in coins they’ve been given. aped inThis refers to the act of investing a significant amount of money in a cryptocurrency without doing much research about it. When the prices go up, investors tend to act on impulse or follow the crowd. The term is not related to the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most popular purveyors of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). B Bitcoin maximalistsThese crypto investors believe the original digital coin is the only one the world will ever need. They’re sticking with that vision and dismiss concerns over its volatility and vast energy consumption. C crypto bridgesThese are software platforms connecting crypto services that can’t otherwise talk to each other. They allow users to move tokens from one blockchain, or digital ledger, to another. These links make it easier for crypto users to invest in a multitude of different projects. They also make the ecosystem more interconnected — which can mean making it more vulnerable if weaker entities run into trouble. And then there’s their vulnerability to theft: In the first half of 2022, over $1 billion was stolen from bridges. crypto winterThis reference to a prolonged decline in crypto markets was used for the 2018 slump that wiped as much as 88% of the market value of all crypto assets. It reemerged in 2022 as digital tokens collapsed again, with Bitcoin falling 76% from its peak in November 2021 to mid-November 2022. While 2024 began as a crypto spring, many are convinced that winter will come again. cold storage/hot walletCautious crypto users keep the keys to their coins offline, in so-called cold storage, typically on a hard drive that isn’t connected to the internet, so they are harder for hackers to steal. Hot wallets are where funds are kept online or with an exchange and ready for trading. When crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, it moved some customers’ digital assets into cold storage to safeguard the accounts. D dappDapps stand for decentralized applications – software programs built on top of a blockchain such as Ethereum. They are decentralized because the underlying blockchains are powered by many computers distributed globally. Dapps operate autonomously as “smart contracts” – rules defined in code recorded on the blockchain that set out actions to be taken when certain conditions are met, without a person or intermediary required. In a maximalist vision, dapps can replace banks and other TradFi middlemen. DeFiDecentralized finance platforms allow people to lend or borrow crypto assets, trade them or bet on changes in their value. DeFi typically functions via automated smart contracts. But the collapse of a number of DeFi platforms, like Anchor, which succumbed after the implosion of a related stablecoin, TerraUSD, in 2022, left some wondering if DeFi was mainly a venue for decentralized frauds promising Ponzi-level returns. diamond handsIt’s a popular mantra – as seen on Reddit and X posts – that roughly means bullish gumption, or a call to hold tight to an investment even during a plunge in prices or an onslaught of headwinds. Traders will frequently use diamond and hand emojis in conjunction when posting about it online. E F FOMOThe fear of missing out is a powerful force in all markets, but is especially potent in a field where, to TradFi eyes, there’s no such thing as fundamental value. Crypto fans often cite FOMO as one of the reasons investors might buy cryptocurrencies when they’re in the midst of a rally. G gasGas refers to the fee required to conduct a transaction on the blockchain. Gas fees are usually denoted in a small denomination of the cryptocurrency of the blockchain. For example, Ethereum’s gas fees are measured in “gwei,” a fraction of Ether. Gas fees can be quite substantial at times when crypto and blockchain activity is at a peak. Crypto users sometimes can pay hundreds of dollars to get their transactions through on the blockchain. H halvingThis is sometimes referred to as halvening – a planned reduction in rewards miners receive (the action is embedded in Bitcoin’s code). Halvings happen once every four years or so – more precisely, every 210,000 blocks of transactions. As the name suggests, each one cuts in half the amount of Bitcoin miners receive per block reward. The practice serves to maintain scarcity. Bitcoin’s halving in 2020 was followed by an eventual rise in its price. hodl“Hold” as it was misspelled by a frenzied Bitcoin trader on an online forum in 2013. It’s become the mantra of cryptocurrency believers during market routs, meant to reassure nervous traders that they should ride out any given slump because of Bitcoin’s long-run advantages. Anyone willing to stomach the volatility is thought to be hodling. I J K L left curveIn the crypto world, there is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.” The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little, and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything. In the crypto rebound of early 2024, when a coin with no real utility, just a cute picture of a dog wearing a hat, increased its value by more than 1,400 times in three months, winners appeared to be concentrated on the left curve. M memecoinsUnlike other well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, which were created with specific financial goals or technological designs, memecoins often start as jokes — like Dogecoin, the biggest memecoin of all. (Its meme is a picture of a skeptical looking Shiba Inu dog.) Some of the most speculative cryptocurrencies introduced in the last few years are trading at record highs, making the jokes expensive ones. The total market value of all memecoins topped $50 billion in March, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. The least useful of these are sometimes referred to as shitcoins. To make things more confusing, there’s an actual cryptocurrency called Shitcoin. But however silly they sound, real money has been made by investors who employ a strategy one described as “being the first idiot in the door.” mixersCrypto transactions tend to be quite transparent as long as they’re carried out on publicly visible blockchains. Mixers are platforms that have been developed to blend tokens deposited by several users to obscure their transaction history and ownership. They are hated by regulators and law enforcement bodies. The operator of one mixer, Bitcoin Fog, was convicted in March on US charges of helping to launder tens of millions of dollars. In a 2020 report, Europol said mixers don’t make cybercriminals invulnerable, but make “cryptocurrency tracing much more challenging.” N NFTA nonfungible token confirms unique ownership of a digital asset. NFTs have been most popularly used for digital art or collectibles such as video clips, memes or items used in online games. At the height of crypto mania in early 2022, NFT series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks were fetching millions of dollars, fired up by endorsements from celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg. Within months, prices of many NFT collections had collapsed. There were signs of a rebound in early 2024, but at levels well below the 2022 peak. normieThe opposite of a Bitcoin maximalist. Many in crypto hope that adding TradFi elements, like ETFs, to the field will bring a flood of normies into the field. O P probably nothingThe phrase is usually used ironically. Crypto users say “probably nothing” when they downplay a major event, such as Ethereum successfully completing its software upgrade. It’s popular in crypto because a lot of events in the crypto world are very technical and can be overlooked by many people who are not technologically savvy. The phrase can also be used to suggest that a conspiracy lies behind some seemingly random event. Q R S stablecoinsSome crypto tokens aim to peg their value to another asset to make them more stable than highly volatile currencies like Bitcoin. Most issuers of stablecoins say they maintain their stability by buying safe assets like US Treasuries. However, the largest stablecoin project, Tether, was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2021 for misleading customers when it claimed the token’s value was “fully backed” by fiat assets. Interest in another category, algorithmic stablecoins, plummeted when the system used by the TerraUSD token for managing supply and demand failed catastrophically. stakingOnly one person can hold a gold coin at a time. But digital currencies could easily be duplicated without a system for ordering transactions. Bitcoin relies on a “proof of work” system in which massive amounts of electricity and computing power are expended on solving puzzles in a way that generates a reliable record of transactions. Ethereum, the network that uses Ether, switched in 2022 to a “proof of stake” system. Computer systems known as “validators” pool assets and are given financial incentives for working together to create such a record through what’s known as staking. Someone who tried to game the system could lose the coins that were staked. T tokenizationA token is something that represents something else, the way a souvenir of the Eiffel Tower is a token of a trip to Paris. The term was adopted by the developers of cryptocurrencies. The concept was then applied to digital art through NFTs, non-fungible tokens. More recently, a wide range of financial players have taken up the idea of “real-world asset tokenization.” That’s the process of representing real assets like bonds, stocks, art or even ownership shares in office buildings as digital tokens on a blockchain. Ownership can be moved easily and almost instantly by simply moving the token from one wallet to another, without the need for complicated clearing transactions. TradFiYou know, like banks and stuff? U V W web3A pitch for a more decentralized World Wide Web built on crypto technology that shifts power back to internet users from giant technology companies. Proponents say the current model, known as web 2.0, gives too much control to a handful of platforms that track our online activity and monetize the information via advertising. Web 1.0 refers to the early days of the internet, when it was simply a way of remotely accessing static pages of text and images. Skeptics say web3 is mostly a term for venture capitalists to hype their latest investments without any reference to their actual utility. whaleIn a wide range of markets, whales are investors whose holdings are so large that their every trade makes waves. It’s a term that sometimes comes with a suspicion of market manipulation. So, too, with crypto whales, or people who hold a lot of crypto. Some estimates show that in the case of many tokens, just a handful control a large percentage of the market, so they have the power to move prices. X Y yield farmingRisk-taking crypto investors put their coins onto yield farming platforms to make a profit. A typical strategy involves lending a token, borrowing another and earning yet another token. At one point, investors were earning triple-digit returns from platforms before a general collapse across the field in 2022. But by late 2023, exchanges ranging from GMX to Binance were offering double-digit incentives as a way to jump-start yield-farming activity after months of stagnation. “It’s always gonna be this way,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “People can’t help it. [Crypto] is literally the most FOMO industry ever.” Z # 51% attackA 51% attack refers to a situation in a blockchain where a single person or group controls 51% or more of the computing power being used to order transactions on a particular blockchain. Having majority control allows the person or group to manipulate the blockchain in several ways, including through so-called double spending where the attacker can spend the same token twice.

This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority – meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution – and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin.On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated “BITCOINERS” on his social media platform Truth Social.He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!”Top crypto players welcomed Trump’s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for – which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry – penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin’s price before Trump’s win – but, like much of the crypto’s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.What does bitcoin hitting the $100k mark mean? Could it keep climbing?Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.“What we’re seeing isn’t just a rally – it’s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin’s place in the financial system,” Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement – while pointing to the growth of who’s entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin’s price don’t necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is “merely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.“It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington’s attitude towards crypto post-election,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. “There is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that’s usually a pretty good recipe for success.”Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin “mining” – the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy – are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.Is it too late to invest? What are the risks?Today’s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren’t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it’s not too late – noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors “still have zero exposure.”At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it’s important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto “FOMO,” or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.“A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone,” Coatsworth noted Thursday. “It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.”In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool – and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

  "title": "From outsider to the Oval Office , bitcoin surges as a new administration embraces crypto",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme. Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump rolls on. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \"the crypto capital of the planet.\"The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year's elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \"works well enough for most transactions.\" But, Nakamoto said, it \"still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\" where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can't be double-spent. \"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\" That is what became the bitcoin network.Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \"digital gold,\" or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \"crypto winters\" that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.\"CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \"$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" "

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 rose 0.4% for its sixth straight day of wins. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.37% even as the country's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. OPEC+ extends oil supply cutThe OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations will postpone plans to roll back several formal and voluntary production cuts into 2026, according to delegate sources, who could only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks. Oil prices ticked up slightly on the news. An unlikely endorsement for bitcoin On Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $96,500. While the initial euphoria may have been triggered by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's planned nomination of Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that bitcoin is \"a competitor for gold\" also helped sentiment. [PRO] Bitcoin is the new gold?Gold has long held a place in investors' portfolios as an asset that hedged against market swings and geopolitical instability. Now bitcoin, with its meteoric rise in popularity and price especially in recent months, might take over the role gold plays, according to strategists. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

  "title": "Asian shares slip on South Korea risk , dollar on guard ahead of payrolls",
  "content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Friday on political ructions in South Korea, while dollar bulls waited anxiously to see if U.S. payrolls challenged or cemented expectations of a rate cut this month. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3% in part due to a 1.7% drop in South Korea's KOSPI. The Korean won fell 0.8% to 1,425.42 per dollar, tumbling towards the low of 1,443.4 hit on Tuesday after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in the country. South Korea's main opposition Democratic Party said on Friday lawmakers were on standby after receiving many reports of another martial law declaration, the Yonhap news agency reported on Friday. In other places, China's blue chips rose 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6% but is up 2.5% for the week. Data showed that Japan's local wages grew at the fastest pace in 32 years in October, although markets are still leaning towards no rate hike from the Bank of Japan this month. All eyes are on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due in the day. Forecasts are centered on a rise of 200,000 jobs in November, rebounding from a soft 12,000 gain in October when the result was impacted by hurricanes and strikes. The unemployment rate likely edged up to 4.2%, from 4.1%. With markets priced for a Goldilocks outcome, risks abound as a really strong report could threaten the prospects of rate cuts while surprisingly soft numbers would amplify concerns about the economy. Futures imply a 70% chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Dec. 18, suggesting the market is vulnerable to a hot jobs report, particularly as in the past week or so futures have climbed to price in an extra quarter point cut for 2025. \"An outcome that comes in below 100k with a U/E rate at 4.2%, and certainly at 4.3%, could see equity under pressure even if this all but assures a 25bp rate cut,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. \"Some may see a risk that an NFP print above 250k with the U/E rate at or below 4.1% could lead to markets derisking as it raises the possibility that the Fed hold off from easing on 18 Dec.\" Overnight, Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors adjusted their positions ahead of the payrolls report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq nonetheless has gained 2.5% so far this week, adding $1 trillion to its market capitalisation. The mighty U.S. dollar fell 0.6% overnight against its peers and was pinned near three-week lows at 105.84 on Friday. Bulls are wary of a sharp pullback given the market has been overwhelmingly long on the greenback. The euro rallied 0.7% overnight and was last flat at $1.0580, after French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned in a widely expected development in the country's political saga. BITCOIN REVERSAL Bitcoin, which hit the $100,000 mark for the first time as investors bet on a friendly U.S. regulatory shift, ran into profit-taking. It tumbled as far as $92,092 before steadying at $98,265 on Friday, up 1% for the day. \"This spike in volatility over the last 24 hours has the hallmarks of a classic blow-off top,\" said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG. \"While we don't see this as the end of the Bitcoin bull run, it does signal we are entering a consolidation phase in the days/weeks ahead.\" Trump late on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks to be his White House Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar. In the bond market, Treasuries were steady on Friday. The two-year yield held at 4.15%, having edged up 2 basis points overnight, while 10-year benchmark Treasury yields were flat at 4.178% and little changed for the week. Oil prices extended falls on Friday despite the decision from OPEC+ to delay a planned hike in output to April. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipped 0.2% to $68.18 a barrel, having dropped 0.4% overnight. [O/R] Gold remained in a tight range and was off 0.4% at $2621.89 per ounce. It is down 1.2% for the week. (Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Sonali Paul) By Stella Qiu"

  "title": "Trump Names David Sacks as White House AI and Crypto Czar",
  "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump says he is selecting venture capitalist David Sacks of Craft Ventures LLC to serve as his artificial intelligence and crypto czar, a newly created position that underscores the president-elect’s intent to boost two rapidly developing industries.Most Read from Bloomberg“David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump said that Sacks would also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.In Sacks, Trump is tapping one of his most prominent Silicon Valley supporters and fundraisers for a prime position in his administration. Sacks played a key role in bolstering Trump’s fundraising among technology industry donors, including co-hosting an event at his San Francisco home in June, with tickets at $300,000 a head.He is also closely associated with Vice President-elect JD Vance, the investor-turned-Ohio senator.Sacks, 52, is a venture capitalist and part of Silicon Valley’s “PayPal Mafia.” Born in South Africa, he moved to the US as a child and later attended Stanford University. He first made his name in the technology industry during a stint as the chief operating officer of PayPal, the payments company whose founders in the late 1990s included billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and investor Peter Thiel. After it was sold to eBay, Sacks turned to Hollywood, where he produced the 2005 satire Thank You for Smoking.Back in Silicon Valley, he founded workplace communications company Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion. He founded his own venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in 2017 and has invested in Musk-owned businesses, including SpaceX.Sacks said on a recent episode of his All-In podcast that a “key man” clause in the agreements of his venture firm’s legal documents would likely prevent him from taking a full-time position, but he might consider an advisory role in the new administration.A Craft spokeswoman said Sacks would not be leaving Craft.In his post, Trump said Sacks “will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.”Protecting free speech is a keen interest of Sacks. He regularly speaks about “woke” interests that try to muzzle unpopular opinions and positions.Crypto CzarThe new post is expected to help spearhead the crypto industry deregulation Trump promised on the campaign trail. The role is expected to provide cryptocurrency advocates a direct line to the White House and serve as a liaison between Trump, Congress and the federal agencies that interface with digital assets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Trump heavily campaigned on supporting crypto, after previously disparaging digital assets during his first White House term, saying their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The president-elect on Thursday said Sacks would “work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.”During the campaign, Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference, accepted crypto campaign donations and met with executives from Bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges multiple times.Trump’s desire to give priority to the digital asset industry is also reflected in his close allies and cabinet selections, including his Commerce secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, and Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent.AI TechOn the AI front, Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Sacks is poised to be at the front lines in determining how the federal government both adopts AI and regulates its use as advances in the technology and adoption by consumers pose a wide array of benefits as well as risks touching on national security, privacy, jobs and other areas.The president-elect has expressed both awe at the power of AI technology as well as concern over the potential harms from its use. During his first term, he signed executive orders that sought to maintain US leadership in the field and directed the federal government to prioritize AI in research and development spending.As AI has become more mainstream in recent years and with Congress slow to act, President Joe Biden has sought to fill that void. Biden signed an executive order in 2023 that establishes security and privacy protections and requires developers to safety-test new models, casting the sweeping regulatory order as necessary to safeguard consumers.A number of technology giants have also agreed to adopt a set of voluntary safeguards which call for them to test AI systems for discriminatory tendencies or security flaws and to share those results.Trump has vowed to repeal Biden’s order. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform dismissed Biden’s executive order as one that “hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.”Musk TiesSacks can be expected to work closely with Musk, the world’s richest person and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. Musk is also a player in the AI space with his company xAI and a chatbot named Grok — efforts which pit him against Silicon Valley’s giants — and he stands to wield significant influence within the incoming administration.The appointment won’t require Sacks to divest or publicly disclose his assets. Like Musk, Sacks will be a special government employee. He can serve a maximum of 130 days per year, with or without compensation.However, conflict of interest rules apply to special government employees, meaning Sacks will have to recuse himself from matters that could impact his holdings.Strong OpinionsSacks’s Craft Ventures is known more for enterprise software investing than for crypto, but it has made a few crypto investments, including BitGo and Bitwise. Still, Sacks has firm opinions on the sector.Speaking last month on All-In, Sacks praised a bill on crypto regulation that had passed in the US House but not the Senate earlier this year. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would regulate certain types of digital assets as a commodity, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The crypto industry basically wants a really clear line for knowing when they’re a commodity and they want commodities to be governed, like all other commodities, by the CFTC,” he said on the November podcast. He also disparaged some of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positions on crypto under its chair, Gary Gensler. “The days of Gensler terrifying crypto companies,” he said. “Those days are about to be over.”Earlier this week, Trump nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.--With assistance from Zoe Ma, Bill Allison and stacy-marie ishmael.(Updates with details on Sacks in sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

  "content": " New clues emerge as investigators hunt for the gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare's CEONEW YORK (AP) — New clues emerged Thursday in the hunt for the masked gunman who stalked and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including possible leads about his travel before the shooting and a message scrawled on ammunition found at the crime scene.The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were found emblazoned on the ammunition, echoing a phrase used by insurance industry critics, two law enforcement officials said Thursday.The words were written in permanent marker, according to one of the two officials, who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.Investigators also now believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, one of the law enforcement officials said.Police and federal agents have been collecting information from Greyhound in an attempt to identify the suspect and are working to determine whether he purchased the ticket to New York in late November, the official said.South Korea's governing party head supports suspending Yoon's powers, making impeachment more likelySEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s governing party chief showed support Friday for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol for imposing martial law this week, in a bombshell reversal that makes Yoon’s impeachment more likely.Opposition parties are pushing for a parliamentary vote on Yoon’s impeachment on Saturday, calling his short-lived martial law declaration an “unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.” But they need support from some members of the president’s People Power Party to get the two-thirds majority required to pass the impeachment motion. The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s nighttime martial law decree has frozen South Korean politics and caused worry among neighbors, including fellow democracy Japan, and Seoul’s top ally, the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader.During a party meeting, PPP leader Han Dong-hun stressed the need to suspend Yoon’s presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he poses a “significant risk of extreme actions, like reattempting to impose martial law, which could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.”Han said he had received intelligence that Yoon had ordered the country’s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of “anti-state activities” during the brief period martial law was in force.“It’s my judgment that an immediate suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s official duties is necessary to protect the Republic of Korea and its people,” Han said.Biden is considering preemptive pardons for officials and allies before Trump takes officeWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is weighing whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, a preemptive move that would be a novel and risky use of the president’s extraordinary constitutional power.The deliberations so far are largely at the level of White House lawyers. But Biden himself has discussed the topic with some senior aides, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday to discuss the sensitive subject. No decisions have been made, the people said, and it is possible Biden opts to do nothing at all.Pardons are historically afforded to those accused of specific crimes – and usually those who have already been convicted of an offense — but Biden’s team is considering issuing them for those who have not even been investigated, let alone charged. They fear that Trump and his allies, who have boasted of enemies lists and exacting “retribution,” could launch investigations that would be reputationally and financially costly for their targets even if they don’t result in prosecutions.While the president’s pardon power is absolute, Biden’s use in this fashion would mark a significant expansion of how they are deployed, and some Biden aides fear it could lay the groundwork for an even more drastic usage by Trump. They also worry that issuing pardons would feed into claims by Trump and his allies that the individuals committed acts that necessitated immunity.Recipients could include infectious-disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was instrumental in combating the coronavirus pandemic and who has become a pariah to conservatives angry about mask mandates and vaccines. Others include witnesses in Trump’s criminal or civil trials and Biden administration officials who have drawn the ire of the incoming president and his allies.Trump names former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to ChinaWASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he is choosing former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to China.Trump said in a social media post that Perdue, a former CEO, “brings valuable expertise to help build our relationship with China.” Perdue pushed Trump's debunked lies about electoral fraud during his failed bid for Georgia governor.Perdue lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff four years ago and ran unsuccessfully in a primary against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.Economic tensions will be a big part of the U.S.-China picture for the new administrationTrump has threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders.Trump is set to receive the 'Patriot of the Year' award at Fox Nation eventGREENVALE, N.Y. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump, largely ensconced at Mar-a-Lago in recent weeks, will make a rare appearance outside his Florida resort to accept the “Patriot of the Year\" award at Fox Nation’s Patriot Awards on Thursday night.Trump, who has been announcing job picks as he builds out his administration, will travel to New York's Long Island for the annual awards ceremony from the Fox News streaming platform. The event is being hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a friend of Trump who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary.The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox.Trump wrote on his Truth Social site earlier this week that he looked \"greatly forward\" to receiving the Patriot of the Year award, an honor he called “so nice!”Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron, Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to help people in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, and Jonathan Diller, the NYPD officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His wife, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for supporting their family after the shooting.Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatusISTANBUL (AP) — A Hamas official said Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach.Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a “reactivation” of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey.Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media.Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could “affect the situation positively” given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be “hell to pay” if that doesn't happen.7.0 earthquake off Northern California prompts brief tsunami warningSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook a large area of Northern California on Thursday, knocking items off grocery store shelves, sending children scrambling under desks and prompting a brief tsunami warning for 5.3 million people along the U.S. West Coast.The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County, about 130 miles (209 km) from the Oregon border, the U.S. Geological Survey said.It was felt as far south as San Francisco, some 270 miles (435 km) away, where residents described a rolling motion for several seconds. It was followed by multiple smaller aftershocks.There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries from the quake, which was the most powerful temblor to hit California since a magnitude 7.1 quake hit Ridgecrest in 2019.The tsunami warning was in effect for roughly an hour. Issued shortly after Thursday's quake struck, it covered nearly 500 miles (805 km) of coastline, from the edge of California’s Monterey Bay north into Oregon.Why the rebel capture of Syria's Hama, a city with a dark history, mattersBEIRUT (AP) — It was one of the darkest moments in the modern history of the Arab world. More than four decades ago, Hafez Assad, then president of Syria, launched what came to be known as the Hama Massacre.Between 10,000 to 40,000 people were killed or disappeared in the government attack on the central Syrian city. It began on Feb. 2, 1982, and lasted for nearly a month, leaving the city in ruins.The memory of the government assault and the monthlong siege on the city, which at the time was a stronghold of Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood, remains visceral in Syrian and Arab minds.Now Islamist insurgents have captured the city, tearing down a poster of Hafez Assad’s son, President Bashar Assad, and swarming security and government offices — scenes unimaginable 40 years ago.The moment carried great symbolism in Syria’s long-running civil war, which began 13 years ago but many say is rooted in Hama.Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy bring Trump's DOGE to Capitol HillWASHINGTON (AP) — Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy spent several hours Thursday swapping ideas with lawmakers about President-elect Donald Trump'sDOGE initiative to dismantle parts of the federal government.Meeting behind closed doors at the Capitol, Musk told the mostly Republican lawmakers they would be keeping a “naughty and nice” list of those who join in the budget slashing proposals and those who don’t, according to lawmakers who attended.“We’re going to see a lot of change around here in Washington,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, as Musk, with his young son on his shoulders, breezed by and into the private meeting.Trump tapped the two business titans to head his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations — all part of what he calls his \"Save America\" agenda for a second term in the White House.Washington has seen this before, with ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government that historically have run into resistance when the public is confronted with cuts to trusted programs that millions of Americans depend on for jobs, health care, military security and everyday needs.House rejects Democratic efforts to force release of Matt Gaetz ethics reportWASHINGTON (AP) — The House shut down Democrats' efforts Thursday to release the long-awaited ethics report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, pushing the fate of any resolution to the yearslong investigation of sexual misconduct allegations into further uncertainty.The nearly party-line votes came after Democrats had been pressing for the findings to be published even though the Florida Republican left Congress and withdrew as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., was the sole Republican to support the effort.Most Republicans have argued that any congressional probe into Gaetz ended when he resigned from the House. Speaker Mike Johnson also requested that the committee not publish its report, saying it would be a terrible precedent to set.While ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare.Shortly before the votes took place, Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., who introduced one of the bills to force the release, said that if Republicans reject the release, they will have “succeeded in sweeping credible allegations of sexual misconduct under the rug.” Gaetz has repeatedly denied the claims.

  "content": " The Kingdom of Bhutan is leveraging digital assets and strategic investments to propel its national development agenda, integrating blockchain technology and sustainable economic planning. The Kingdom’s digital transformation has been, for the most part, shaped by the approach of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Operating a few years ahead of government initiatives, DHI has laid the groundwork for Bhutan’s digital governance by creating foundational capacities that the government is now integrating into its plans. One of Bhutan’s most notable digital government efforts is the National Digital Identity (NDI) platform, a decentralized national identity system program that is now part of the Global Acceptance Network. Initially developed by DHI, NDI was spun off as a 100 percent DHI-owned startup and has become a cornerstone of Bhutan’s public service modernization, according to reports from GovInsider. Another achievement by DHI is the national carbon registry, which leverages AI and blockchain technologies. The registry is set to enable Bhutan to trade carbon credits on global markets. Additionally, DHI has supported the creation of the Bhutanverse, a metaverse platform that brings together local talent to contribute to a virtual ecosystem. National digital strategy This all feeds into the country’s 13th five year plan, put together by the Royal Government of Bhutan and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), that will see the implementation of a digital development and transformation strategy that focuses on bettering governance, service delivery and private sector growth. Put simply, the plan includes further integration of NDI into public service delivery, in a bid to deliver on its potential to improve governance and citizen access to services. According to the UNDP’s strategy paper, the government is prioritizing digital ID systems, expanding broadband connectivity, and fostering digital literacy across rural and urban areas. These initiatives aim to reduce inequalities, create new economic opportunities, and empower marginalized communities, ensuring that Bhutanese citizens can fully participate in the country’s digital economy. As Bhutan prepares for the nationwide implementation of the NDI, the UNDP urges for the rapid expansion of mobile connectivity in order to solidify its success. Blockchain for sovereign wealth In line with the Kingdom’s blockchain efforts, analysis by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence has revealed that Bhutan ranks as the fourth-largest government holder of Bitcoin globally. The Kingdom holds 13,000 BTC, valued at $750 million. The Bitcoin holdings are managed by DHI, which has quietly positioned the small Himalayan kingdom ahead of well-known crypto adopters such as El Salvador. In 2021, Bhutan entered partnerships with blockchain firms like Ripple and Bitdeer to explore the potential of digital assets. These collaborations aim to develop Bhutan’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and enhance digital payments infrastructure. Ripple is assisting the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan in piloting its CBDC, which is envisioned to support financial inclusion by enabling accessible payment systems. Concurrently, Bitdeer is collaborating with the government to scale its cryptocurrency mining operations.

  "content": "Illinois Public Radio says Bitcoin just hit the $100,000 mark—can you believe it? And it’s not just a one-time thing; this milestone is being driven by a whole bunch of factors that have crypto fans dancing in the streets (or at least on the platform formally known as Twitter). Regulatory ShiftsFinally, it seems like the government might actually start getting the crypto world. There’s growing hope that the rules are going to shift in a way that makes it easier for people to invest in bitcoin without worrying about the regulatory hammer coming down. This is all part of the plan to make crypto less of a wild, unpredictable ride, and more of a mainstream option. Wall Street’s Love Affair with BitcoinInstitutional investors are totally in on the game now. Big names like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are launching bitcoin ETFs, which is like the VIP pass for crypto to join the elite financial club. I had to look it up. I was not familiar with what a bitcoin ETF was. It is an exchange-traded fund and how it works and the definition is located here from Investopedia.With more money coming in from these big players, bitcoin’s legitimacy is skyrocketing—and so is its price. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold RushYou know how people talk about gold as the “safe haven” investment? Well, bitcoin’s basically trying to elbow its way into that club. Recently, the Fed’s Jerome Powell even said bitcoin is just like gold—only digital. How do you pan for that? The family and I are headed west to pan for digital cryptocurrency. Canva/TSMCanva/TSMloading...People aren’t using it to buy coffee (yet), but they’re certainly starting to think of it as a store of value. And when that happens, investors start paying attention. If you're paying with a $100K bitcoin, it might be kinda hard to make change. Pro-Crypto MovesThere’s a growing buzz that things are going to get even better for bitcoin. Imagine a world where there’s no tax on crypto transactions, and bitcoin companies can go public with ease. Sounds pretty sweet, right? It’s all part of a vision for a more crypto-friendly future that’s helping push bitcoin’s value higher. Bitcoin’s 2024 Glow-UpBitcoin’s up 140% this year—no, that’s not a typo. The price has been on fire, and a lot of it comes from investors finally realizing that maybe, just maybe, bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. The price has been climbing ever since the election, and people are feeling pretty good about the future of crypto. So yeah, hitting $100,000 isn’t just a big number—it’s a sign that bitcoin’s slowly becoming a staple in the world of finance. It’s no longer just a “what-if” experiment; it’s here to stay, and investors are all about it. Canva/TSMCanva/TSMloading...What's the Deal with Bitcoin in Iowa?In Iowa, the Iowa Department of Commerce (IDOB) regulates virtual currency kiosks. The IDOB can process complaints against licensees and can be contacted at craig.christensen@idob.state.ia.usThe State of Iowa says that the Iowa Division of Banking issued a clarification about virtual currency kiosks (like bitcoin ATMs) in Iowa. According to Iowa law, virtual currency is considered \"monetary value,\" so kiosks that exchange U.S. dollars for virtual currency are engaging in \"money transmission,\" and therefore need a money transmitter license.Initially, the Division thought kiosks didn’t need a license as long as they used their own reserves, didn’t hold customer funds, and only handled transactions between the customer and operator. However, they've realized that kiosks might send virtual currency to a third party’s wallet, not just the customer’s, making it qualify as money transmission.As a result, if a kiosk operator in Iowa allows virtual currency to be sent to a third party’s wallet, they must be licensed unless exempt under Iowa law. If you spot an unlicensed kiosk, you can report it to the Division at craig.christensen@idob.state.ia.us.Eastern Iowa's Best Holiday Light Displays for 2024We want to see your beautiful light display!Gallery Credit: Johnny MarksSlang Names Iowans Use For Cities & Towns in IowaThe 'I Grew Up In Iowa' Facebook Group was asked for slang terms for towns in Iowa that you have used or know of.Gallery Credit: Sloppy Joe"

  "content": " By Christine Idzelis Investors are also watching France after its government fell this week Hello! This week's ETF Wrap looks at what the recent political turmoil in South Korea and France means for investors. Please send feedback and tips to christine.idzelis@marketwatch.com or isabel.wang@marketwatch.com. You can also follow me on X at @cidzelis and find me on LinkedIn. Isabel Wang is at @Isabelxwang. Sign up here for our weekly ETF Wrap. It's been a head-spinning week for exchange-traded-fund investors monitoring geopolitical risks to stocks in their portfolios. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Dec. 3, accusing his political opposition of sympathizing with North Korea and sparking a selloff in the country's stocks. Buying the drop in South Korean equities spurred by the martial-law declaration seems fine to Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research and author of \"Geopolitical Alpha: An Investment Framework for Predicting the Future.\" He said in a phone interview that \"geopolitical events rarely have staying power,\" adding that although it was a \"very big\" negative surprise that the president of South Korea effectively tried \"to do a coup against his own parliament,\" the move failed. Yoon's \"own party, right away, as it was happening, said it was unconstitutional,\" said Papic. \"The guy's done. They're calling for his impeachment.\" The iShares MSCI South Korea ETF EWY, Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF FLKR and Matthews Korea Active ETF MKOR all dropped on Dec. 3, ending the day sharply lower even after bouncing from the initial selloff early in the trading session, according to FactSet data. Shares of all three ETFs fell Thursday, deepening their losses this week and year to date. Still, South Korea's democracy demonstrated \"resiliency\" at a time when incumbent governments are being challenged globally, according to Papic. \"The response from both government and civil society\" showed South Korea's \"checks and balances and strength of institutions are strong,\" said Perth Tolle, founder of Life + Liberty Indexes, in an email to MarketWatch. Tolle's Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF FRDM - which tracks an index of emerging-market stocks based on personal- and economic-freedom metrics and excludes authoritarian regimes - currently has a 14% weight to South Korea. \"Our methodology results in higher exposure to countries with stronger institutions, rule of law, and checks and balances,\" said Tolle. South Korea provided \"a good test of all those things, and so far, the outcome appears consistent with their allocation in the FRDM index strategy,\" she said, referring to the ticker of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF. Shares of the fund are up 3.8% this week through Thursday, bringing its year-to-date gain to 5.2%, according to FactSet data. By contrast, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF has plunged more than 15% so far in 2024. Although South Korea is often categorized as an emerging market when it comes to investing indexes, that label is a \"borderline\" case, as the country's market is similar to Japan, said Jason Hsu, founder and chief investment officer of Rayliant Global Advisors, in a phone interview. The actively managed Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF RAYE has South Korean company Samsung Electronics Co. (KR:005930) in its portfolio as a core holding, said Hsu. Beyond making televisions, Samsung manufactures semiconductor components, he noted. Read: Samsung Electronics Rallies After $7 Billion Buyback Plan Shares of the Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF have climbed almost 10.7% this year through Thursday, FactSet data show. In Hsu's view, the sharp drop in South Korean stocks on Dec. 3, when markets \"freaked out and sold\" on the surprise declaration of martial law, presented a buying opportunity. The country changes presidents \"quite regularly,\" and when they exit, often they don't \"go quietly,\" he said. The president declaring martial law may have been just \"a slightly different spin on not wanting to leave\" after becoming unpopular, according to Hsu. But \"there was never any real risk that you got this military government coup,\" he said, because the South Korean president is \"democratically elected and doesn't control the military.\" French government collapses Meanwhile, the French government fell on Wednesday after lawmakers in France voted to oust Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The no-confidence vote left French President Emmanuel Macron needing to appoint a new prime minister. While the unfolding of events in South Korea seemed a bit \"comical\" to Papic, he said those in France are \"more serious.\" Investors might want to wait for the new government to be created before buying French stocks, as the situation will then be \"pretty much over no matter who comes to power,\" he said. Macron announced Thursday that he would stay in office until the end of his term and that he will name a new prime minister within days of the ousted Barnier's resignation, according to an Associated Press report. The iShares MSCI France ETF EWQ is up 1.2% this week through Thursday, but remains down in 2024 with a 6.3% decline year to date, FactSet data show. Stick with U.S. stocks? ETF investors clearly favored U.S. equities over international stocks last month, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas ETF research at State Street Global Advisors. He found that 97% of November's equity flows into U.S.-listed ETFs went into funds targeting U.S. stocks. \"Everyone was stockpiling U.S. exposures, given the strong market sentiment\" following the election of Donald Trump as president, as well as the country's stronger economy and stock market compared to the rest of the world, Bartolini said in a phone interview. Check out: How Treasury yields are driving whether U.S. stocks beat the rest of the world Strong momentum in the U.S. stock market is fueled in part by expected tax cuts under President-elect Trump, said Papic. That, along with the uncertainty surrounding tariffs under the incoming White House administration, makes it more difficult for people seeking to invest internationally over the next six months, according to his thinking. The \"powerful consensus view\" is more \"upside\" for U.S. equities, he said.

  "title": "  Buy the Dip : Lee Bold S & P 6 , 300 Prediction",
  "content": " In a recent segment on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, provided insights into what the recent rally in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) signifies for market risk appetite and what investors might expect in the equity markets moving forward. Lee suggested that the surge in Bitcoin’s price is a clear indicator that investors are embracing risk, signaling a release of pent-up capital that had been sidelined for years. He views this movement as a precursor for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), suggesting that the equity markets might follow suit with their own breakout from a holding pattern. Discussing potential hurdles in the broader market, Lee pointed to several macroeconomic events over the next few weeks that could influence investor sentiment. He highlighted upcoming job support data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision. These events, particularly if they indicate stronger-than-expected economic data or a shift in Fed policy, could introduce volatility. However, Lee remains optimistic, positing that once these events pass, the market could see a “Santa Claus rally,” pushing the S&P towards 6,300 by year’s end. His advice to investors was to either hold steady or buy into any dips, anticipating further upside post these key events. When questioned about the market’s reaction to potential Fed policy adjustments, Lee noted a conceptual shift in market perception. Earlier in the year, more aggressive rate cuts were seen as bullish for stocks. However, moving into 2025, he predicts the market might favor fewer rate cuts as it would suggest a longer dovish cycle, which could be beneficial for equities. This shift, however, isn’t fully embraced by the market yet, as evidenced by reactions to Fed Chair Powell’s recent comments. Regarding international political turmoil, Lee wasn’t surprised by the lack of significant market reaction, attributing this to the markets already pricing in global risks, particularly the divergence between U.S. and other global markets throughout the year. Lastly, Lee touched on the performance of active managers, noting a significant shift over the last decade. He highlighted that this year has been particularly good for those who took a tactical, offensive approach, especially in tech, leading to notable outperformance against benchmarks. However, he acknowledged that this success is not widespread, particularly for those employing macro or market-neutral strategies. Through his commentary, Lee painted a picture of a market at a pivotal point, where understanding the nuances of economic indicators, monetary policy, and global dynamics will be key to navigating potential market movements in the coming weeks.

  "title": "Trump SEC Nomination Draws Strong Reactions | Chief Investment Officer",
  "content": " Advocacy groups representing institutional investors have praised President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins, an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008, is the founder and CEO of risk management and compliance consultancy Patomak Global Partners. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,” stated Trump’s Wednesday announcement on Truth Social. “He believes in the promise of robust innovative capital markets that are responsive to the need of investors, and that provide capital to make our economy the best in the world.” Atkins is expected to replace SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who announced he would step down from his position upon Trump’s January 20, 2025, inauguration. Gensler’s term was set to end in 2026. In a statement, the American Securities Association, an advocate for retail and institutional capital markets interests, applauded the nomination. “ASA welcomes Paul Atkins’ nomination to lead the SEC, and we applaud President Trump for making an excellent choice with this pick,” said Chris Iacovella, the ASA’s CEO and president, in a statement. “Paul is well-versed on investor protection, capital markets, market structure, and public company issues. We look forward to working with him to rebuild the public’s trust and confidence in the agency.” The Investment Advisers Association, an advocacy firm which represents investment advisory firms, also commended Atkin’s nomination. “The IAA congratulates Paul Atkins on being nominated as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission,” an IAA release stated. “Atkins is an experienced and thoughtful regulator who understands the crucial role that investment advisers play for their clients and the need to calibrate regulation for small businesses.” The Investment Company Institute, a lobbying firm representing regulated Investment funds, stated that “[Atkins’] distinguished record, years of experience in the industry, and history of service at the SEC make him a supremely well qualified nominee. Atkins understands that registered fund companies play a major role in the US economy. His leadership will be vital to ensuring the strength, fairness, and integrity of our financial markets. We look forward to working with him to promote the interests of registered funds and the more than 120 million investors they serve.” Atkins is not without critics; he was a commissioner when the Madoff Investment Securities fraud occurred without detection by the SEC, and his tenure led up to the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. “The U.S. stock market is the envy of the world precisely because the SEC promotes safe and transparent markets that protect investors from getting cheated, so I’m concerned about putting at the helm of the SEC a Wall Street lobbyist whose main contribution during the last financial crisis was to protest fines against the giant corporations that defrauded investors,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, in a statement. Warren is expected to become the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in the next Congress. Debate Over Cryptocurrency Continues Atkins is considered supportive of the cryptocurrency industry, and after his nomination, the price of bitcoin rose greater than $100,000 for the first time. Atkins’ nomination was praised by those in the crypto industry, who bemoaned what they considered overregulation by the SEC under Gensler. Since 2017, Atkins has been a member and co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance, a blockchain trade association. “Paul Atkins is an excellent choice by President-elect Trump for SEC chair,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of crypto advocacy firm the Blockchain Association. “The past four years under Chair Gensler was a non-stop anti-crypto crusade, leading to an innovation stalemate and incalculable job, talent, and economic losses. Paul Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem.” Consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen was critical of Atkins’ nomination, accusing the crypto industry of buying itself the control of the “nation’s investor protection police.” “Any sentient being—let alone a securities markets expert—should understand that bitcoin is ‘thin air,’ as Trump himself once put it,” said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, in a scathing statement. “That Paul Atkins has made a living promoting such a scam doesn’t bode well for his reflexes as a shepherd for investor protection. As an SEC veteran, industry consultant and lobbyist, Atkins will be keenly able to reshape the SEC, either to vandalize or improve investor protections. We obviously hope he understands that, if confirmed, he will be expected to work on behalf of average Americans, not his consulting clients, crypto or otherwise.” Atkins must be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the position on January 20, 2025.

  "title": "Officials warn of Bitcoin machine scams",
  "content": "CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - To keep the holidays jolly, authorities are urging people not to fall for scams involving Bitcoin machines.It happened recently in the Heartland when an 81-year-old southern Illinois man lost his life savings to a scammer.The ploy involves the scammer contacting the victim, hoping to trick them into giving up large amounts of money.According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost more than $110 million to this type of scam in 2023.Sydney Waters with the Better Business Bureau said scammers like to use Bitcoin transactions in their schemes because they’re not monitored.“What people don’t realize is these transactions are not approved by banks, so it’s really just between you and the person you’re sending the money to, and unfortunately sometimes just you and the scammer. So these are very high-risk transactions no matter what platform you’re using,” Waters said.Waters said there are several red flags to look for, and anything unsolicited is a big one.If a text or call comes through unexpectedly about verifying changes made to an account with a bank or business, it’s questionable.“What they’re doing is they’re trying to get you to call and release all of your sensitive banking information, or sometimes just scare you...into transferring all of your money into a Bitcoin account to keep it safe,” Waters said.That’s something a legitimate banker would never ask a client to do.“The bankers are there to protect your funds, so they will never reach out to you and ask you to transfer your money into any kind of Bitcoin account to keep it safe,” Waters said.Scammers may also impersonate a government official or someone with a delivery service. The thing to watch for is someone pushing for confirmation of personal data, through text, over the phone, or by sending a link to fill out an online form.“Just by clicking that link, you can download malware onto your device, so you don’t even have to go any further,” Waters said. “Any hyperlinks that you get, go ahead and just block that number, call your bank directly, and let them know what’s going on.”People can be sure they have the authentic phone number for their bank by checking the one listed on their financial statements, or by visiting BBB.org and looking at vetted phone numbers listed there.Copyright 2024 KFVS.

  "content": " Representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin and words “$100.000” are seen in this illustration taken on Nov 24.—Reuters WASHINGTON: US president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday took credit for bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000, telling his social media followers “you’re welcome” after the cryptocurrency jumped more than 50 per cent since his election victory. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump, who in September launched his own crypto platform, wrote on Truth Social. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Thursday after Trump nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the incoming president will deregulate the sector. The digital unit has enjoyed a blistering rally since the Nov 5 election of Trump, who pledged to make the United States the “bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world”. Bitcoin hit a record of $103,800.45 in Asian trading hours on Thursday before dipping back to around $101,000. Following Trump’s remarks, it began climbing again, reaching $103,320. The volatile asset has soared by around 140pc since the turn of the year. However, its advance had stalled in recent weeks, sitting just below $100,000 as traders awaited new catalysts before jumping in to buy. That came after Trump, who takes office in January, announced on Wednesday that he would nominate Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins, an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, founded risk consultancy firm Patomak Global Partners in 2009, whose clients include companies in the banking, trading and cryptocurrency industries. An announcement from the Trump transition team noted that Atkins had been co-chairman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, which promotes the use of digital assets, since 2017. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,” Trump said in a statement that emphasised Atkins’ commitment to “robust, innovative” capital markets. Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, who led a crackdown on the sector after a 2022 market rout. Even so, the SEC this year authorised the trading on the American market of two new financial products, allowing a wider public to buy cryptocurrencies, called ETFs (exchange-traded funds).

  "content": "The price of bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, soaring to a fresh high as the world's largest cryptocurrency extended a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump.Bitcoin has climbed more than 40% since Election Day, when voters opted for a candidate viewed as friendly toward digital currency.Those gains have far outpaced the stock market. The S&P 500 has increased about 2.4% over that period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped 2.6%.On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.Trump said he would replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom many crypto proponents dislike for what they perceive as a robust approach to crypto regulation.FILE - Bitcoin logos are displayed at the Inside Bitcoins conference and trade show on April 7, 2014, in New York. Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark.AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, FileGensler announced that he plans to resign on Jan. 20, 2025, the date of Trump's inauguration.The post-election euphoria has lifted other parts of the crypto sector. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has climbed 27%. Lesser-known dogecoin has skyrocketed about 140%, while litecoin has surged 35%.Shares of Coinbase, a top crypto trading platform, have increased more than 70% since Trump's reelection.The growth in recent weeks extends a remarkable turnabout for the once-beleaguered crypto industry. The sector entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.FTX, a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed in November 2022. The implosion set off a 17-month legal saga that resulted in the conviction of Bankman-Fried for fraud. In April, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in April after pleading guilty to charges that his platform had enabled illicit financial activity.The reelection of Trump marks the latest in a series of positive developments that have buoyed cryptocurrency this year.Those gains have been propelled, in part, by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.Last month, options on BlackRock's popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were made available for trading on the Nasdaq. The options, which provide a new avenue for bitcoin investors, allow individuals to commit to buy or sell the ETF at a given price by a specific date. While such investments typically come with additional risk, they can also make large payouts.IBIT inched upward 1% on Friday, reaching a record high of about $56.Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, attributed the recent crypto surge to investors' anticipation of friendly policy under Trump, as well as the newly available options trading for bitcoin ETFs.Still, the performance of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, has proven volatile, Armour added. The price of bitcoin could fall, especially if Trump encounters difficulty following through on his campaign commitments, he said.\"As long as the narrative stays positive, there's always room to grow,\" Armour told ABC News before bitcoin reached $100,000. \"I also think campaign promises don't always come to fruition.\"\"It's still a highly volatile asset,\" Armour added.Copyright © 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures."

  "title": "Crypto Glossary : A List of Top Terms to Know , From A - Z",
  "content": "Explainer A Crypto GlossaryFrom airdrops to yield farming, here’s a modest guide to the terms and jargon that separate the normies from the true believers.June 16, 2024, 12:01 AM UTCIn the beginning was the (made up) word: Bitcoin. And the words that came with it: Blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptocurrencies. Face it, while crypto’s arc of innovation touches many things — computer science, economics, finance — its biggest breakthrough may be its constant supply of fresh vernacular, a trend that shows no sign of depletion. Enemies are named (“TradFi”), propaganda unmasked (“FUD”) and battlefields defined (“web3”). Among crypto bulls, jargon is almost as big a currency as Bitcoin itself. Pseudoscientific language is traded online with virtually the same gusto as memecoins and NFTs. Some of the terms stick around, and some fade away. Here’s a selection of crypto slang worth knowing, whether you’ve got diamond hands or are just a normie. A airdropThink of getting free samples when you shop at a store. Crypto projects give tokens for free to users in exchange for their having taken actions that could be seen as assisting the idea, such as interacting with the code. Airdrops are also a way to build interest in new coins, since they are only valuable if they have a community of users – ideally, airdrop recipients have an incentive to promote interest in coins they’ve been given. aped inThis refers to the act of investing a significant amount of money in a cryptocurrency without doing much research about it. When the prices go up, investors tend to act on impulse or follow the crowd. The term is not related to the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most popular purveyors of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). B Bitcoin maximalistsThese crypto investors believe the original digital coin is the only one the world will ever need. They’re sticking with that vision and dismiss concerns over its volatility and vast energy consumption. C crypto bridgesThese are software platforms connecting crypto services that can’t otherwise talk to each other. They allow users to move tokens from one blockchain, or digital ledger, to another. These links make it easier for crypto users to invest in a multitude of different projects. They also make the ecosystem more interconnected — which can mean making it more vulnerable if weaker entities run into trouble. And then there’s their vulnerability to theft: In the first half of 2022, over $1 billion was stolen from bridges. crypto winterThis reference to a prolonged decline in crypto markets was used for the 2018 slump that wiped as much as 88% of the market value of all crypto assets. It reemerged in 2022 as digital tokens collapsed again, with Bitcoin falling 76% from its peak in November 2021 to mid-November 2022. While 2024 began as a crypto spring, many are convinced that winter will come again. cold storage/hot walletCautious crypto users keep the keys to their coins offline, in so-called cold storage, typically on a hard drive that isn’t connected to the internet, so they are harder for hackers to steal. Hot wallets are where funds are kept online or with an exchange and ready for trading. When crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, it moved some customers’ digital assets into cold storage to safeguard the accounts. D dappDapps stand for decentralized applications – software programs built on top of a blockchain such as Ethereum. They are decentralized because the underlying blockchains are powered by many computers distributed globally. Dapps operate autonomously as “smart contracts” – rules defined in code recorded on the blockchain that set out actions to be taken when certain conditions are met, without a person or intermediary required. In a maximalist vision, dapps can replace banks and other TradFi middlemen. DeFiDecentralized finance platforms allow people to lend or borrow crypto assets, trade them or bet on changes in their value. DeFi typically functions via automated smart contracts. But the collapse of a number of DeFi platforms, like Anchor, which succumbed after the implosion of a related stablecoin, TerraUSD, in 2022, left some wondering if DeFi was mainly a venue for decentralized frauds promising Ponzi-level returns. diamond handsIt’s a popular mantra – as seen on Reddit and X posts – that roughly means bullish gumption, or a call to hold tight to an investment even during a plunge in prices or an onslaught of headwinds. Traders will frequently use diamond and hand emojis in conjunction when posting about it online. E F FOMOThe fear of missing out is a powerful force in all markets, but is especially potent in a field where, to TradFi eyes, there’s no such thing as fundamental value. Crypto fans often cite FOMO as one of the reasons investors might buy cryptocurrencies when they’re in the midst of a rally. G gasGas refers to the fee required to conduct a transaction on the blockchain. Gas fees are usually denoted in a small denomination of the cryptocurrency of the blockchain. For example, Ethereum’s gas fees are measured in “gwei,” a fraction of Ether. Gas fees can be quite substantial at times when crypto and blockchain activity is at a peak. Crypto users sometimes can pay hundreds of dollars to get their transactions through on the blockchain. H halvingThis is sometimes referred to as halvening – a planned reduction in rewards miners receive (the action is embedded in Bitcoin’s code). Halvings happen once every four years or so – more precisely, every 210,000 blocks of transactions. As the name suggests, each one cuts in half the amount of Bitcoin miners receive per block reward. The practice serves to maintain scarcity. Bitcoin’s halving in 2020 was followed by an eventual rise in its price. hodl“Hold” as it was misspelled by a frenzied Bitcoin trader on an online forum in 2013. It’s become the mantra of cryptocurrency believers during market routs, meant to reassure nervous traders that they should ride out any given slump because of Bitcoin’s long-run advantages. Anyone willing to stomach the volatility is thought to be hodling. I J K L left curveIn the crypto world, there is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.” The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little, and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything. In the crypto rebound of early 2024, when a coin with no real utility, just a cute picture of a dog wearing a hat, increased its value by more than 1,400 times in three months, winners appeared to be concentrated on the left curve. M memecoinsUnlike other well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, which were created with specific financial goals or technological designs, memecoins often start as jokes — like Dogecoin, the biggest memecoin of all. (Its meme is a picture of a skeptical looking Shiba Inu dog.) Some of the most speculative cryptocurrencies introduced in the last few years are trading at record highs, making the jokes expensive ones. The total market value of all memecoins topped $50 billion in March, according to CoinMarketCap’s data. The least useful of these are sometimes referred to as shitcoins. To make things more confusing, there’s an actual cryptocurrency called Shitcoin. But however silly they sound, real money has been made by investors who employ a strategy one described as “being the first idiot in the door.” mixersCrypto transactions tend to be quite transparent as long as they’re carried out on publicly visible blockchains. Mixers are platforms that have been developed to blend tokens deposited by several users to obscure their transaction history and ownership. They are hated by regulators and law enforcement bodies. The operator of one mixer, Bitcoin Fog, was convicted in March on US charges of helping to launder tens of millions of dollars. In a 2020 report, Europol said mixers don’t make cybercriminals invulnerable, but make “cryptocurrency tracing much more challenging.” N NFTA nonfungible token confirms unique ownership of a digital asset. NFTs have been most popularly used for digital art or collectibles such as video clips, memes or items used in online games. At the height of crypto mania in early 2022, NFT series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks were fetching millions of dollars, fired up by endorsements from celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg. Within months, prices of many NFT collections had collapsed. There were signs of a rebound in early 2024, but at levels well below the 2022 peak. normieThe opposite of a Bitcoin maximalist. Many in crypto hope that adding TradFi elements, like ETFs, to the field will bring a flood of normies into the field. O P probably nothingThe phrase is usually used ironically. Crypto users say “probably nothing” when they downplay a major event, such as Ethereum successfully completing its software upgrade. It’s popular in crypto because a lot of events in the crypto world are very technical and can be overlooked by many people who are not technologically savvy. The phrase can also be used to suggest that a conspiracy lies behind some seemingly random event. Q R S stablecoinsSome crypto tokens aim to peg their value to another asset to make them more stable than highly volatile currencies like Bitcoin. Most issuers of stablecoins say they maintain their stability by buying safe assets like US Treasuries. However, the largest stablecoin project, Tether, was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2021 for misleading customers when it claimed the token’s value was “fully backed” by fiat assets. Interest in another category, algorithmic stablecoins, plummeted when the system used by the TerraUSD token for managing supply and demand failed catastrophically. stakingOnly one person can hold a gold coin at a time. But digital currencies could easily be duplicated without a system for ordering transactions. Bitcoin relies on a “proof of work” system in which massive amounts of electricity and computing power are expended on solving puzzles in a way that generates a reliable record of transactions. Ethereum, the network that uses Ether, switched in 2022 to a “proof of stake” system. Computer systems known as “validators” pool assets and are given financial incentives for working together to create such a record through what’s known as staking. Someone who tried to game the system could lose the coins that were staked. T tokenizationA token is something that represents something else, the way a souvenir of the Eiffel Tower is a token of a trip to Paris. The term was adopted by the developers of cryptocurrencies. The concept was then applied to digital art through NFTs, non-fungible tokens. More recently, a wide range of financial players have taken up the idea of “real-world asset tokenization.” That’s the process of representing real assets like bonds, stocks, art or even ownership shares in office buildings as digital tokens on a blockchain. Ownership can be moved easily and almost instantly by simply moving the token from one wallet to another, without the need for complicated clearing transactions. TradFiYou know, like banks and stuff? U V W web3A pitch for a more decentralized World Wide Web built on crypto technology that shifts power back to internet users from giant technology companies. Proponents say the current model, known as web 2.0, gives too much control to a handful of platforms that track our online activity and monetize the information via advertising. Web 1.0 refers to the early days of the internet, when it was simply a way of remotely accessing static pages of text and images. Skeptics say web3 is mostly a term for venture capitalists to hype their latest investments without any reference to their actual utility. whaleIn a wide range of markets, whales are investors whose holdings are so large that their every trade makes waves. It’s a term that sometimes comes with a suspicion of market manipulation. So, too, with crypto whales, or people who hold a lot of crypto. Some estimates show that in the case of many tokens, just a handful control a large percentage of the market, so they have the power to move prices. X Y yield farmingRisk-taking crypto investors put their coins onto yield farming platforms to make a profit. A typical strategy involves lending a token, borrowing another and earning yet another token. At one point, investors were earning triple-digit returns from platforms before a general collapse across the field in 2022. But by late 2023, exchanges ranging from GMX to Binance were offering double-digit incentives as a way to jump-start yield-farming activity after months of stagnation. “It’s always gonna be this way,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “People can’t help it. [Crypto] is literally the most FOMO industry ever.” Z # 51% attackA 51% attack refers to a situation in a blockchain where a single person or group controls 51% or more of the computing power being used to order transactions on a particular blockchain. Having majority control allows the person or group to manipulate the blockchain in several ways, including through so-called double spending where the attacker can spend the same token twice.

  "content": " The re-election of Trump on November 5 has added US$1,43 trillion to cryptocurrency’s overall market capitalisation. THE world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, Bitcoin, has breached the US$100 000 mark for the first time since its emergence in 2008, buoyed by former US President Donald Trump being re-elected. According to the leading cryptocurrency tracking website, Coin Market Cap, yesterday, one Bitcoin was trading for approximately US$102 830,67, spurring its overall market capitalisation to reach US$2,03 trillion. Consequently, the entire cryptocurrency market soared to a market capitalisation of US$3,69 trillion, making it more valuable than the world’s largest company by valuation, American technology firm, Apple Incorporated, whose valuation stands at US$3,67 trillion. The re-election of Trump on November 5 has added US$1,43 trillion to cryptocurrency’s overall market capitalisation. “It’s official: BTC (Bitcoin) has crossed the US$100 000 mark, shattering expectations and cementing its place in financial history,” the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, said of Bitcoin’s achievement in a statement yesterday. “What started as an experiment in cryptographic wizardry built on a noble and idealistic intellectual foundation is now a six-figure phenomenon, rewriting the rules of money, trust, and innovation “Love it or hate it, this milestone is a global event, the kind that future generations will read about in history books (or, more likely, on blockchain-verified e-readers).” However, Binance said the road to US$100 000 was not a straight line.Keep Reading In Conversation with Trevor: ICT guru Stafford Masie speaks out In Conversation with Trevor: ICT guru Stafford Masie speaks out Cryptocurrency could revolutionize banking in Zimbabwe Cryptocurrency could revolutionize banking in Zimbabwe “After hitting US$69 000 in 2021, Bitcoin faced brutal bear markets, macroeconomic uncertainty, industry scandals and regulatory crackdowns. Critics jeered, ‘Tulip mania!’ holders shrugged, ‘Just another day in crypto’,” Binance added. “Then came the great pivot: central banks printed trillions during economic crises, inflation soared, and people sought a hedge. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, looked increasingly like digital gold. Adoption skyrocketed. Price followed. “The prospect of a crypto-friendly US administration in the United States has amplified this already powerful momentum. Donald Trump’s campaign-trail promises to transform the US into a global crypto hub and establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve further bolstered investor confidence in Bitcoin. While crypto was bound to find its way into the mainstream, these political dynamics accelerated Bitcoin’s ascent.” Zimbabwean economist Stevenson Dlamini described Bitcoin as a better store of value. “Bitcoin is one of the best value preserving peer-to-peer payment method invented by mankind. It’s value has been on average increasing surpassing USD$100 000,” Dlamini said. “Zimbabwe is making efforts to create its own online cryptocurrency and the success, like all other blockchain technology, depends on the trust and confidence that the transacting public will have on it. “The history of banning cryptocurrencies will have a bearing on adoption, but just like all new technologies, there is almost always some resistance.” Trump will assume office once again on January 20, 2025, for a four-year term. In Zimbabwe, the introduction of bond notes in November 2016 caused inflation to spike as it did not have adequate support systems, making consumers turn to Bitcoin trading the following year. As local Bitcoin trading grew, however, its decentralised nature inhibited the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s ability to control it, and thus on May 11, 2018, the central bank issued banned cryptocurrency. But this has not stopped locals from trading in cryptocurrency, with Zimbabwe boasting a booming market where people are making thousands of dollars monthly. Its growth and general acceptance globally have since led the authorities to have a rethink. In June this year, it was revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe and RBZ were working on a framework to allow for the trading of virtual assets. This comes as the failure of the Zimbabwe dollar, RTGS dollar, bond notes and coins nearly forced the central bank to consider full cryptocurrency adoption before deciding on the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, introduced on April 5 this year. Local banks, however, revealed they were not yet equipped to fully adopt and facilitate cryptocurrency trading. Related Topics "

  "content": " Hailey Welch joins a long list of famous (and infamous) people who pushed ruinous memecoin offerings. Here's a quick reminder after the launch of Hawk Tuah girl Hailey Welch's crypto: Memecoins are a dangerous investment. Credit: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images Bitcoin has just hit $100,000.Buoyed by Donald Trump's reelection and the promise of a pro-cryptocurrency administration, crypto investors are going all in on the digital currency. With the price of Bitcoin rising high, cryptocurrency is seemingly seeping back into the public consciousness after the crypto crashes of 2022.And, it appears the memecoin fad is having a resurgence right now too. On the same day Bitcoin hit its new six-figure record high, the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" girl Hailey Welch launched her own cryptocurrency token $HAWK. Upon launch, $HAWK jumped to a market cap of $500 million. Within minutes, the token crashed. Its current market cap is around $36 million. Hawk Tuah fans quickly took to social media to share how they lost thousands of dollars.Things are starting to look a lot like 2021 all over again. During the last crypto rush of 2021, some celebrities and online influencers quickly saw that there was money to be made. Some musicians, reality TV stars, and e-sports names endorsed altcoins or even went ahead and made their own branded memecoins.Cryptocurrency is a risky investment to begin with. Crypto tokens are a highly volatile speculative asset. There is currently very little governmental oversight or regulation when it comes to the crypto market. Even Bitcoin, seen as the most \"safe\" bet in the crypto world, has had major ebbs and flows. If you have to sell during one of the down periods, you might lose a chunk of change. Mashable Light Speed Furthermore, now anyone can create a crypto token. Over the past few years, there have been platforms that have helped make the process very easy. Dogecoin, easily the most popular memecoin, set a standard of success that no other memecoin has been able to replicate.Yet, the allure of making easy money and getting rich quick through crypto tokens and memecoins have drawn in lots of money from people. Back in 2021, memecoins created by celebrities and influencers were all the rage. As Mashable reported then, many turned out to be a scam.Rug pulls are quite common with memecoins, especially those created by influencers and celebrities. Here's what often happens: A famous or notable individual launches a memecoin. Their fans are encouraged to purchase to support their favorite creator while also making money for themselves. However, before the memecoin is officially launched, the memecoin creator puts aside a certain amount of tokens for themselves or their friends. They either give these out freely or provide an unadvertised pre-launch sale at well below the price that the token will go for at launch. When the token does go on sale, the public buys, pushing the value of the memecoin up. But, as soon as that happens, those who received coins at pre-launch dump their holdings for profit, plummeting its value and eventually crashing the memecoin. The celebrity or influencer's fans are often then left holding the bag, their money tied up in a now-worthless token that they will never be able to sell. It may seem obvious that one should not accept financial advice from celebrities. Way back in 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a stark warning about the speculative machinations of public figures. \"Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements,\" Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin wrote in the same statement announcing Floyd Mayweather Jr. and DJ Khaled were charged with illegally touting initial coin offerings. \"Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they’re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.\"However, in an age or parasocial relationships, many fans feel like they can trust their favorite influencers. There's a feeling that \"they wouldn't scam me.\" But, time and time again, celebrity memecoins have failed, with insiders making money off of the influencer's fans. Tweet may have been deleted Take the aforementioned and recently launched $HAWK. In a X Spaces stream, YouTuber Coffeezilla who investigates cryptocurrency scams, confronts Welch and the developers behind her crypto token about how things played out after the launch. Its a tale we've heard before. The vast majority of the tokens were held by just a few crypto wallets before the public launch. After it launched, according to Coffeezilla, those insiders dumped the token. $HAWK's value plummeted and all of those buyers who got in at launch are left with a significant financial loss.There is no recourse for those memecoin buyers. There are no refunds, no way for them to get their money back. Most memecoins have zero utility, so there's no use case for the tokens either. The only way they're getting back what they put in is if Welch and her team can somehow convince another group of suckers to put their money into this worthless token.Hopefully, after reading this, you won't be one of those suckers.

  "title": "Trump attends Fox Nation event , receives  Patriot of the Year  award",
  "content": " Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. GREENVALE, N.Y. — Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election. Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation’s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform. “I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. “It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID. Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows. “Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” — a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary. Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well. The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect. The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.\" He played “YMCA” — the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies — and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon. Later, he donned an orange safety vest — a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years. Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again. Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends. Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal. On Thursday, he was more magnanimous. “You have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.\" Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month. This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago. ___ AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

  "content": " In Brief Posted: 5:43 PM PST · December 5, 2024 Image Credits:TechCrunch Incoming President Donald Trump has a new crypto and AI “czar”: ex-PayPal COO David Sacks. Trump announced Sacks’ appointment Thursday in a post on Truth Social, Trump’s social networking platform. “[Sacks] will work on a legal framework so the Crypto [sic] industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,” he wrote. Sacks, a member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia,” is a co-founder of Yammer, the internal communications tool that Microsoft acquired for $1.2 billion in 2012. He’s also behind Craft Ventures, a VC fund that has backed startups including SpaceX, Reddit, and ClickUp. In an interview with CNBC in 2017, Sacks said he believed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum fulfill the “original vision” of PayPal: creating a “database of money” in which payments never leave the system. Sacks’ views on AI and AI policymaking are less obvious, though his policies generally are decidedly right-leaning and deregulatory, which could well mean a lighter touch than the outgoing Biden administration favored.

  "content": "HONG KONG (AFP) – Asian markets mostly fell Friday at the end of a volatile week, with South Korean stocks and the won still under pressure with the president’s job hanging by a thread as he faces impeachment. Traders were looking for a little stability after the past few days that saw Seoul plunged into crisis, France’s government fall and bitcoin surge to a historic high above USD100,000. They are also gearing up for the release of US jobs data, while keeping tabs on Donald Trump as he puts together his cabinet, with signs so far suggesting he will take a hawkish tone on trade, fuelling worries about another standoff with China. Shares in Seoul sank more than one percent and the won weakened to about 1,423 per dollar as lawmakers prepare to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol’s dramatic, short-lived martial law on Tuesday night. While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing. On Friday the head of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country. Han Dong-hoon’s remarks — virtually guaranteeing enough votes to impeach — come just a day after he said he would block the impeachment, and another party leader insisted all 108 PP members would back the president. “Considering the newly emerging facts, I believe that a swift suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s duties is necessary to safeguard the Republic of Korea and its people,” Han said. The losses in Seoul were in line with a sell-off across most of Asia, which came after all three main indexes on Wall Street retreated from record highs Thursday. US investors were biding their time ahead of key US jobs data Friday that could play a role in the Federal Reserve’s decision-making on whether or not to cut interest rate this month. Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington, Manila, Taipei all fell. Hong Kong and Shanghai rose, however, with investors hoping for some fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week. That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that the painful growth slowdown that has wracked the country for almost two years could be coming to an end. Bitcoin surge abates Bitcoin was hovering just below USD98,000 in Asian business, having blasted to the historic peak of USD103,800 the day before, helped by news that Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the nation’s markets regulator. (FILES) This illustration photograph taken on November 22, 2024 in Istanbul shows a coin imitation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart. PHOTO: AFP The tycoon, who often remarked on his election campaign that he would deregulate the crypto sector, welcomed the milestone. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” said Trump, who in September launched his own crypto platform, on Truth Social. Events in Paris are being closely watched after a historic no-confidence vote that ousted the government of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a battle over a controversial budget. President Emmanuel Macron vowed to name a new prime minister in the coming days to prevent France from sliding deeper into political turmoil, rejecting growing pressure from the opposition to resign. However, there was some hope that the crisis could be settled after far-right leader Marine Le Pen — a key opponent of Barnier — said in a television interview that once a new premier was appointed, her party “would let them work” and did not call on Macron to resign. The euro edged down slightly but was much stronger than the levels around USD1.0500 seen Thursday. "

  "content": "Illinois Public Radio says Bitcoin just hit the $100,000 mark—can you believe it? And it’s not just a one-time thing; this milestone is being driven by a whole bunch of factors that have crypto fans dancing in the streets (or at least on the platform formally known as Twitter). Regulatory ShiftsFinally, it seems like the government might actually start getting the crypto world. There’s growing hope that the rules are going to shift in a way that makes it easier for people to invest in bitcoin without worrying about the regulatory hammer coming down. This is all part of the plan to make crypto less of a wild, unpredictable ride, and more of a mainstream option. Wall Street’s Love Affair with BitcoinInstitutional investors are totally in on the game now. Big names like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are launching bitcoin ETFs, which is like the VIP pass for crypto to join the elite financial club. I had to look it up. I was not familiar with what a bitcoin ETF was. It is an exchange-traded fund and how it works and the definition is located here from Investopedia.With more money coming in from these big players, bitcoin’s legitimacy is skyrocketing—and so is its price. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold RushYou know how people talk about gold as the “safe haven” investment? Well, bitcoin’s basically trying to elbow its way into that club. Recently, the Fed’s Jerome Powell even said bitcoin is just like gold—only digital. How do you pan for that? The family and I are headed west to pan for digital cryptocurrency. Canva/TSMCanva/TSMloading...People aren’t using it to buy coffee (yet), but they’re certainly starting to think of it as a store of value. And when that happens, investors start paying attention. If you're paying with a $100K bitcoin, it might be kinda hard to make change. Pro-Crypto MovesThere’s a growing buzz that things are going to get even better for bitcoin. Imagine a world where there’s no tax on crypto transactions, and bitcoin companies can go public with ease. Sounds pretty sweet, right? It’s all part of a vision for a more crypto-friendly future that’s helping push bitcoin’s value higher. Bitcoin’s 2024 Glow-UpBitcoin’s up 140% this year—no, that’s not a typo. The price has been on fire, and a lot of it comes from investors finally realizing that maybe, just maybe, bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. The price has been climbing ever since the election, and people are feeling pretty good about the future of crypto. So yeah, hitting $100,000 isn’t just a big number—it’s a sign that bitcoin’s slowly becoming a staple in the world of finance. It’s no longer just a “what-if” experiment; it’s here to stay, and investors are all about it. Canva/TSMCanva/TSMloading...What's the Deal with Bitcoin in Iowa?In Iowa, the Iowa Department of Commerce (IDOB) regulates virtual currency kiosks. The IDOB can process complaints against licensees and can be contacted at craig.christensen@idob.state.ia.usThe State of Iowa says that the Iowa Division of Banking issued a clarification about virtual currency kiosks (like bitcoin ATMs) in Iowa. According to Iowa law, virtual currency is considered \"monetary value,\" so kiosks that exchange U.S. dollars for virtual currency are engaging in \"money transmission,\" and therefore need a money transmitter license.Initially, the Division thought kiosks didn’t need a license as long as they used their own reserves, didn’t hold customer funds, and only handled transactions between the customer and operator. However, they've realized that kiosks might send virtual currency to a third party’s wallet, not just the customer’s, making it qualify as money transmission.As a result, if a kiosk operator in Iowa allows virtual currency to be sent to a third party’s wallet, they must be licensed unless exempt under Iowa law. If you spot an unlicensed kiosk, you can report it to the Division at craig.christensen@idob.state.ia.us.Eastern Iowa's Best Holiday Light Displays for 2024We want to see your beautiful light display!Gallery Credit: Johnny MarksSlang Names Iowans Use For Cities & Towns in IowaThe 'I Grew Up In Iowa' Facebook Group was asked for slang terms for towns in Iowa that you have used or know of.Gallery Credit: Sloppy Joe"

  "content": " The Kingdom of Bhutan is leveraging digital assets and strategic investments to propel its national development agenda, integrating blockchain technology and sustainable economic planning. The Kingdom’s digital transformation has been, for the most part, shaped by the approach of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Operating a few years ahead of government initiatives, DHI has laid the groundwork for Bhutan’s digital governance by creating foundational capacities that the government is now integrating into its plans. One of Bhutan’s most notable digital government efforts is the National Digital Identity (NDI) platform, a decentralized national identity system program that is now part of the Global Acceptance Network. Initially developed by DHI, NDI was spun off as a 100 percent DHI-owned startup and has become a cornerstone of Bhutan’s public service modernization, according to reports from GovInsider. Another achievement by DHI is the national carbon registry, which leverages AI and blockchain technologies. The registry is set to enable Bhutan to trade carbon credits on global markets. Additionally, DHI has supported the creation of the Bhutanverse, a metaverse platform that brings together local talent to contribute to a virtual ecosystem. National digital strategy This all feeds into the country’s 13th five year plan, put together by the Royal Government of Bhutan and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), that will see the implementation of a digital development and transformation strategy that focuses on bettering governance, service delivery and private sector growth. Put simply, the plan includes further integration of NDI into public service delivery, in a bid to deliver on its potential to improve governance and citizen access to services. According to the UNDP’s strategy paper, the government is prioritizing digital ID systems, expanding broadband connectivity, and fostering digital literacy across rural and urban areas. These initiatives aim to reduce inequalities, create new economic opportunities, and empower marginalized communities, ensuring that Bhutanese citizens can fully participate in the country’s digital economy. As Bhutan prepares for the nationwide implementation of the NDI, the UNDP urges for the rapid expansion of mobile connectivity in order to solidify its success. Blockchain for sovereign wealth In line with the Kingdom’s blockchain efforts, analysis by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence has revealed that Bhutan ranks as the fourth-largest government holder of Bitcoin globally. The Kingdom holds 13,000 BTC, valued at $750 million. The Bitcoin holdings are managed by DHI, which has quietly positioned the small Himalayan kingdom ahead of well-known crypto adopters such as El Salvador. In 2021, Bhutan entered partnerships with blockchain firms like Ripple and Bitdeer to explore the potential of digital assets. These collaborations aim to develop Bhutan’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and enhance digital payments infrastructure. Ripple is assisting the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan in piloting its CBDC, which is envisioned to support financial inclusion by enabling accessible payment systems. Concurrently, Bitdeer is collaborating with the government to scale its cryptocurrency mining operations.

  "content": "Asian markets mostly fell Friday at the end of a volatile week, with South Korean stocks and the won still under pressure with the president's job hanging by a thread as he faces impeachment.Traders were looking for a little stability after the past few days that saw Seoul plunged into crisis, France's government fall and bitcoin surge to a historic high above $100,000.They are also gearing up for the release of US jobs data, while keeping tabs on Donald Trump as he puts together his cabinet, with signs so far suggesting he will take a hawkish tone on trade, fuelling worries about another standoff with China.Shares in Seoul sank more than one percent and the won weakened to about 1,423 per dollar as lawmakers prepare to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol's dramatic, short-lived martial law on Tuesday night.While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing.On Friday the head of Yoon's ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country.Han Dong-hoon's remarks -- virtually guaranteeing enough votes to impeach -- come just a day after he said he would block the impeachment, and another party leader insisted all 108 PP members would back the president.\"Considering the newly emerging facts, I believe that a swift suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol's duties is necessary to safeguard the Republic of Korea and its people,\" Han said.The losses in Seoul were in line with a sell-off across most of Asia, which came after all three main indexes on Wall Street retreated from record highs Thursday.US investors were biding their time ahead of key US jobs data Friday that could play a role in the Federal Reserve's decision-making on whether or not to cut interest rate this month.Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington, Manila, Taipei all fell.Hong Kong and Shanghai rose, however, with investors hoping for some fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week.That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that the painful growth slowdown that has wracked the country for almost two years could be coming to an end.Bitcoin was hovering just below $98,000 in Asian business, having blasted to the historic peak of $103,800 the day before, helped by news that Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the nation's markets regulator.The tycoon, who often remarked on his election campaign that he would deregulate the crypto sector, welcomed the milestone.\"CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!\" said Trump, who in September launched his own crypto platform, on Truth Social.Events in Paris are being closely watched after a historic no-confidence vote that ousted the government of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a battle over a controversial budget.President Emmanuel Macron vowed to name a new prime minister in the coming days to prevent France from sliding deeper into political turmoil, rejecting growing pressure from the opposition to resign.However, there was some hope that the crisis could be settled after far-right leader Marine Le Pen -- a key opponent of Barnier -- said in a television interview that once a new premier was appointed, her party \"would let them work\" and did not call on Macron to resign.The euro edged down slightly but was much stronger than the levels around $1.0500 seen ThursdayTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.9 percent at 39,042.59 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.2 percent at 19,602.27Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.1 percent at 3,370.68Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0572 from $1.0591 on ThursdayPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2749 from $1.2760Dollar/yen: UP at 150.11 yen from 150.09 yenEuro/pound: DOWN at 82.93 from 82.97 penceWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.1 percent at $68.21 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.2 percent at $71.95 per barrelNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.6 percent at 44,765.71 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.2 percent at 8,349.38 (close)"

  "title": "Bitcoin has surpassed $100 , 000 mark as post - election rally continues . What next ? ",
  "content": " NEW YORK — Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time this week as a massive rally in the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on. The cryptocurrency officially rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Bitcoin fell back below $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting just above $99,000 by 3 p.m. ET. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of Bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history. Here’s what you need to know. WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY? Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you’ve heard about it more and more over the last few years. In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority – meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution – and transactions get recorded with a technology called a blockchain. Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, XRP, tether and Dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions. WHY IS BITCOIN SOARING? A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a Bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies. On Thursday morning, hours after Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated “BITCOINERS” on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” Top crypto players welcomed Trump’s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for – which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections. Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017. Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry — penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process. One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin’s price before Trump’s win – but, like much of the crypto’s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. COULD BITCOIN KEEP CLIMBING? Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing. “What we’re seeing isn’t just a rally – it’s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin’s place in the financial system,” Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement – while pointing to the growth of who’s entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption. Still, others note that the new heights of Bitcoin’s price don’t necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is “merely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary. That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward. “It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington’s attitude towards crypto post-election,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. “There is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that’s usually a pretty good recipe for success.” Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin “mining” – the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy – are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through. IS IT TOO LATE TO INVEST? Today’s excitement around Bitcoin may make many who aren’t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it’s not too late — noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors “still have zero exposure.” At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it’s important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto “FOMO,” or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors. “A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone,” Coatsworth noted Thursday. “It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.” In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day. Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And late 2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with Bitcoin falling below $17,000. Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool – and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then the early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean fewer guardrails. "

  "title": "What driving the rise in Bitcoin value ? – Deseret News",
  "content": "Art is an award-winning reporter who covers advanced industry and technology on the Deseret News' special projects team. Bitcoin may have just marked its ascension into the mainstream investment world by passing the $100,000 valuation mark late Wednesday, continuing a post-election growth wave for a cryptocurrency market driven by investor enthusiasm for President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to institute a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in his second term.While Trump is a past critic of cryptocurrencies and at one point warned that investments in the digital tokens were a “scam,” he has since pivoted to the role of crypto proponent and made repeated pledges during his campaign to create a friendly space for the sector. Among his pro-crypto comments was a promise made during a July keynote speech at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville that under his administration, “the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.”On Wednesday, Trump made good on that pledge, selecting Paul Atkins to head up the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, is widely known as a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency market.Trump highlighted Atkins’ stance on digital currencies in a Wednesday announcement of the selection, posted on Truth Social.“Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,” Trump wrote. “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.”Current SEC Chairman Gary Ginsler previously announced he would step down on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Ginsler oversaw numerous enforcement actions focused on the crypto industry during his tenure.The cryptocurrency market has exploded since Bitcoin made its public debut in 2009 and the current portfolio of digital tokens numbers in the tens of thousands. Market volatility has been a benchmark of those virtual currencies as regulators in the U.S. and around the world have struggled to assemble a framework that suits the decentralized currencies.Bitcoin broke the $100,000 line late Wednesday and was trading at around $101,400 at midday Thursday but had dropped back to just under $99,000 per token on Thursday afternoon, according to tracking by CoinGecko. At that time, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization came in just shy of $3.8 trillion.Financial experts warn that even as bitcoin and other digital currencies appear to be on an upward swing, similar value jumps in the past have also been followed by downswings.A Thursday report from The Wall Street Journal notes crypto’s “striking reversal from its early years as a cypherpunk rebellion against the establishment” as it becomes more widely accepted by the same system it was designed to thwart.“I find it very ironic,” Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at Clearmatics, a London-based blockchain company, told The Wall Street Journal. “The whole purpose of bitcoin was to create an alternative payment infrastructure outside of traditional finance and government surveillance. Now some bitcoiners are looking to embrace governments, or even get subsidies.”Crypto investment for beginnersFor those interested in taking a first step into crypto investment, there are numerous how-to’s out there, including a primer from Investopedia that offers some basic guidelines, though it’s guidance rife with reminders that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and lack many of the regulatory protections of the legacy brokerage realm.The investment guidance website notes buying Bitcoin and other digital currencies can seem complicated if you haven’t done it, but it’s relatively simple. It just requires an account at a service or an exchange and a way to store your purchases safely.To dive into the world of crypto investment you must select an appropriate service or venue, connect with a payment method, place an order and ensure stable storage for purchased cryptocurrency. Each of those steps requires research and a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the relevant service. Bitcoin is available at bitcoin ATMs or from payment services like PayPal and mainstream brokerage firms like Robinhood or Coinbase.What if you want to sell your crypto?You can sell your crypto tokens through the same exchange that mediates your purchases though the transactions are also subject to fees.Investopedia strongly advises those interested in becoming cryptocurrency investors to thoroughly research crypto exchanges and their services before making an investment. The site also includes this warning about a major difference in investments made through legacy brokerage firms versus crypto exchanges:“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are not protected by insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). At regular brokerages, the agency protects against the loss of securities and cash in brokerage accounts containing up to $500,000, with a $250,000 cash limit. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase have crime insurance to protect their infrastructure against hacks. But that insurance doesn’t protect individual customers from password theft.”"

  "title": "Officials warn of Bitcoin machine scams",
  "content": "CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - To keep the holidays jolly, authorities are urging people not to fall for scams involving Bitcoin machines.It happened recently in the Heartland when an 81-year-old southern Illinois man lost his life savings to a scammer.The ploy involves the scammer contacting the victim, hoping to trick them into giving up large amounts of money.According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost more than $110 million to this type of scam in 2023.Sydney Waters with the Better Business Bureau said scammers like to use Bitcoin transactions in their schemes because they’re not monitored.“What people don’t realize is these transactions are not approved by banks, so it’s really just between you and the person you’re sending the money to, and unfortunately sometimes just you and the scammer. So these are very high-risk transactions no matter what platform you’re using,” Waters said.Waters said there are several red flags to look for, and anything unsolicited is a big one.If a text or call comes through unexpectedly about verifying changes made to an account with a bank or business, it’s questionable.“What they’re doing is they’re trying to get you to call and release all of your sensitive banking information, or sometimes just scare you...into transferring all of your money into a Bitcoin account to keep it safe,” Waters said.That’s something a legitimate banker would never ask a client to do.“The bankers are there to protect your funds, so they will never reach out to you and ask you to transfer your money into any kind of Bitcoin account to keep it safe,” Waters said.Scammers may also impersonate a government official or someone with a delivery service. The thing to watch for is someone pushing for confirmation of personal data, through text, over the phone, or by sending a link to fill out an online form.“Just by clicking that link, you can download malware onto your device, so you don’t even have to go any further,” Waters said. “Any hyperlinks that you get, go ahead and just block that number, call your bank directly, and let them know what’s going on.”People can be sure they have the authentic phone number for their bank by checking the one listed on their financial statements, or by visiting BBB.org and looking at vetted phone numbers listed there.Copyright 2024 KFVS.

  "title": "Trump Names David Sacks as White House AI and Crypto Czar",
  "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump says he is selecting venture capitalist David Sacks of Craft Ventures LLC to serve as his artificial intelligence and crypto czar, a newly created position that underscores the president-elect’s intent to boost two rapidly developing industries.Most Read from Bloomberg“David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump said that Sacks would also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.In Sacks, Trump is tapping one of his most prominent Silicon Valley supporters and fundraisers for a prime position in his administration. Sacks played a key role in bolstering Trump’s fundraising among technology industry donors, including co-hosting an event at his San Francisco home in June, with tickets at $300,000 a head.He is also closely associated with Vice President-elect JD Vance, the investor-turned-Ohio senator.Sacks, 52, is a venture capitalist and part of Silicon Valley’s “PayPal Mafia.” Born in South Africa, he moved to the US as a child and later attended Stanford University. He first made his name in the technology industry during a stint as the chief operating officer of PayPal, the payments company whose founders in the late 1990s included billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and investor Peter Thiel. After it was sold to eBay, Sacks turned to Hollywood, where he produced the 2005 satire Thank You for Smoking.Back in Silicon Valley, he founded workplace communications company Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion. He founded his own venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in 2017 and has invested in Musk-owned businesses, including SpaceX.Sacks said on a recent episode of his All-In podcast that a “key man” clause in the agreements of his venture firm’s legal documents would likely prevent him from taking a full-time position, but he might consider an advisory role in the new administration.A Craft spokeswoman said Sacks would not be leaving Craft.In his post, Trump said Sacks “will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.”Protecting free speech is a keen interest of Sacks. He regularly speaks about “woke” interests that try to muzzle unpopular opinions and positions.Crypto CzarThe new post is expected to help spearhead the crypto industry deregulation Trump promised on the campaign trail. The role is expected to provide cryptocurrency advocates a direct line to the White House and serve as a liaison between Trump, Congress and the federal agencies that interface with digital assets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Trump heavily campaigned on supporting crypto, after previously disparaging digital assets during his first White House term, saying their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The president-elect on Thursday said Sacks would “work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.”During the campaign, Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference, accepted crypto campaign donations and met with executives from Bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges multiple times.Trump’s desire to give priority to the digital asset industry is also reflected in his close allies and cabinet selections, including his Commerce secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, and Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent.AI TechOn the AI front, Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Sacks is poised to be at the front lines in determining how the federal government both adopts AI and regulates its use as advances in the technology and adoption by consumers pose a wide array of benefits as well as risks touching on national security, privacy, jobs and other areas.The president-elect has expressed both awe at the power of AI technology as well as concern over the potential harms from its use. During his first term, he signed executive orders that sought to maintain US leadership in the field and directed the federal government to prioritize AI in research and development spending.As AI has become more mainstream in recent years and with Congress slow to act, President Joe Biden has sought to fill that void. Biden signed an executive order in 2023 that establishes security and privacy protections and requires developers to safety-test new models, casting the sweeping regulatory order as necessary to safeguard consumers.A number of technology giants have also agreed to adopt a set of voluntary safeguards which call for them to test AI systems for discriminatory tendencies or security flaws and to share those results.Trump has vowed to repeal Biden’s order. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform dismissed Biden’s executive order as one that “hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.”Musk TiesSacks can be expected to work closely with Musk, the world’s richest person and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. Musk is also a player in the AI space with his company xAI and a chatbot named Grok — efforts which pit him against Silicon Valley’s giants — and he stands to wield significant influence within the incoming administration.The appointment won’t require Sacks to divest or publicly disclose his assets. Like Musk, Sacks will be a special government employee. He can serve a maximum of 130 days per year, with or without compensation.However, conflict of interest rules apply to special government employees, meaning Sacks will have to recuse himself from matters that could impact his holdings.Strong OpinionsSacks’s Craft Ventures is known more for enterprise software investing than for crypto, but it has made a few crypto investments, including BitGo and Bitwise. Still, Sacks has firm opinions on the sector.Speaking last month on All-In, Sacks praised a bill on crypto regulation that had passed in the US House but not the Senate earlier this year. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would regulate certain types of digital assets as a commodity, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The crypto industry basically wants a really clear line for knowing when they’re a commodity and they want commodities to be governed, like all other commodities, by the CFTC,” he said on the November podcast. He also disparaged some of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positions on crypto under its chair, Gary Gensler. “The days of Gensler terrifying crypto companies,” he said. “Those days are about to be over.”Earlier this week, Trump nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.--With assistance from Zoe Ma, Bill Allison and stacy-marie ishmael.(Updates with details on Sacks in sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

  "title": "  Buy the Dip : Lee Bold S & P 6 , 300 Prediction",
  "content": " In a recent segment on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, provided insights into what the recent rally in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) signifies for market risk appetite and what investors might expect in the equity markets moving forward. Lee suggested that the surge in Bitcoin’s price is a clear indicator that investors are embracing risk, signaling a release of pent-up capital that had been sidelined for years. He views this movement as a precursor for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), suggesting that the equity markets might follow suit with their own breakout from a holding pattern. Discussing potential hurdles in the broader market, Lee pointed to several macroeconomic events over the next few weeks that could influence investor sentiment. He highlighted upcoming job support data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision. These events, particularly if they indicate stronger-than-expected economic data or a shift in Fed policy, could introduce volatility. However, Lee remains optimistic, positing that once these events pass, the market could see a “Santa Claus rally,” pushing the S&P towards 6,300 by year’s end. His advice to investors was to either hold steady or buy into any dips, anticipating further upside post these key events. When questioned about the market’s reaction to potential Fed policy adjustments, Lee noted a conceptual shift in market perception. Earlier in the year, more aggressive rate cuts were seen as bullish for stocks. However, moving into 2025, he predicts the market might favor fewer rate cuts as it would suggest a longer dovish cycle, which could be beneficial for equities. This shift, however, isn’t fully embraced by the market yet, as evidenced by reactions to Fed Chair Powell’s recent comments. Regarding international political turmoil, Lee wasn’t surprised by the lack of significant market reaction, attributing this to the markets already pricing in global risks, particularly the divergence between U.S. and other global markets throughout the year. Lastly, Lee touched on the performance of active managers, noting a significant shift over the last decade. He highlighted that this year has been particularly good for those who took a tactical, offensive approach, especially in tech, leading to notable outperformance against benchmarks. However, he acknowledged that this success is not widespread, particularly for those employing macro or market-neutral strategies. Through his commentary, Lee painted a picture of a market at a pivotal point, where understanding the nuances of economic indicators, monetary policy, and global dynamics will be key to navigating potential market movements in the coming weeks.

Ethereum rose beyond $3,950 for the first time since mid-March, before falling into the $3,800 zone later in the day. The crash triggered cryptocurrency liquidations worth $969 million in the last 24 hours, with $774 million in leveraged longs getting wiped out. The liquidation of overleveraged longs cooled down the market as funding rates dropped considerably. Traders interpreted this as a bullish signal, as accounts on Binance placing long positions for Bitcoin surged sharply in comparison to those betting against the asset, per the Long/Shorts Ratio.

  "title": "Bitcoin hits $100 , 000 for the first time : 3 things to know : NPR",
  "content": " SCOTT DETROW, HOST: Bitcoin just crossed a big milestone. It hit over $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, and it's pretty remarkable for a cryptocurrency that was created just over 15 years ago. For more on this, we are joined by NPR's senior business editor, Rafael Nam. Hey, Rafael.RAFAEL NAM, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So what has led bitcoin to this milestone at this particular moment?NAM: In short, the election of Donald Trump as president. Just a few years ago, Trump called cryptocurrencies a scam, but he's changed his mind. In July, when he gave a speech at a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, he wanted to make one thing clear.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: This afternoon, I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world, and we'll get it done.(CHEERING)NAM: And Trump went on to make several promises, the main one being that he would appoint regulators who would be a lot friendlier to the industry than the current administration. So when Trump won the election, bitcoin just took off. To give you a perspective, bitcoin was trading just under $70,000 on Election Day. And now, a month later, it's trading at six figures. That's a gain of over 40%.DETROW: I think there are a lot of signs that these promises won Trump a lot of votes. So he hasn't taken office yet, but so far, at least, is he delivering on the promises?NAM: He is. Bitcoin hit the $100,000 milestone just hours after he nominated Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's the agency that has oversight of financial markets, and Atkins has experience as a financial regulator. But the big reason why crypto investors are so excited is that Atkins backs cryptocurrencies. He now runs a consultancy with crypto companies as clients. And if confirmed, he would replace the current chair, who is very skeptical of cryptocurrencies.DETROW: There is some reason for that skepticism, though - right? - because cryptocurrencies has a sketchy past, to put it technically. And I think a lot of people probably still associate them with activities like drug trade, right?NAM: That's exactly right. That's why there's a lot of people who are very alarmed. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are widely used for all kinds of illegal activities, like you mentioned, including also ransomware, I should add. It also has a history of scams and fraud. And historically, it's been very volatile. Remember, just over two years ago, the biggest crypto exchange at the time, FTX, collapsed. And its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of fraud and is now serving a 25-year prison term. That's quite a comeback in just two years for bitcoin.DETROW: Let's go back to that first data point, though, where it is on the market. What do these big gains mean for bitcoin?NAM: Gosh, there's a lot of excitement, and it's not just Trump. Bitcoin is going more mainstream now. Cities like Detroit are now even accepting cryptocurrencies for payments, like for taxes, and many banks and trading firms are allowing people like you and me to invest in bitcoin now through these investment funds called exchange-traded funds. But again, keep in mind one thing, Scott. Bitcoin is still very young and is incredibly volatile. Yes, it does have a history of big rallies, but it also has a history of big falls.DETROW: That is NPR's Rafael Nam. Thank you so much. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

This acquisition reflects the growing influence of crypto wealth, highlighted by Bitcoin's surge past $100,000. Sun's investment follows his $30 million stake in Donald Trump's crypto project, showcasing his expanding presence in the digital asset space.ETMarkets.comA cryptocurrency entrepreneur and founder of the blockchain platform Tron, Justin Sun— with a net worth of at least $1.4 billion— has spent $6.2 million on Maurizio Cattelan’s viral artwork \"Comedian\"—a banana duct-taped to a wall— amid a historic boom for digital assets. The high-profile purchase underscores how crypto wealth is reshaping investment trends and cultural value.The conceptual work created by the Italian artist was sold at an auction in New York on November 20, with Justin Sun comparing that conceptual art to NFT (non-fungible token) art and decentralised blockchain technology, The Guardian had reported. Sun’s extravagant purchase on November 20 follows his $30 million investment in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The blockchain mogul has become WLFI’s largest token holder and an advisor to the venture, signaling his deepening ties to the booming cryptocurrency ecosystem.Crypto TrackerWe are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial @worldlibertyfi as its largest investor.

Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) November 25, 2024 Likewise, Sun’s bold foray into the art world echoes the speculative ethos of crypto space. Cattelan’s Comedian, dismissed by some as a stunt and lauded by others as a cultural critique, encapsulates the fluidity of value in the modern era—whether measured in Bitcoin or bananas.Bitcoin, which crossed the $100,000 threshold on Thursday, has fueled a broader rally in the crypto market, boosting fortunes for early adopters like Sun. Since founding Tron in 2017, Sun has expanded his portfolio to include the file-sharing firm Rainberry (formerly BitTorrent) and the cryptocurrency exchange HTX, South China Morning Post had reported.Also read | Jane Street’s Rs 4.3 crore job offer to IIT student sheds light on options trading inequitiesHow Justin Sun made a fortune from crypto Sun’s wealth and influence in the crypto world have grown despite his ongoing regulatory challenges. He faces scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged securities violations and has struggled to secure licensing for HTX’s operations in Hong Kong, where he now resides.The Chinese-born crypto mogul's net worth is estimated to be at least $1.4 billion, according to data available on blockchain analytics platforms.Before founding Tron Blockchain, Sun had started the social media app Peiwo (Accompany Me) in 20213, which the crypto mogul aspired to turn into China's Snapchat. The app was soon banned in the country for disrupting socialist values, The Verge had reported. Tron Blockchain had raised about $70 million after selling a proprietary crypto token called TRX, which currently has 86 billion tokens in circulation. A year after founding Tron Blockchain, Sun bought file-sharing pioneer BitTorrent Inc for $140 million. Sun, who refers to himself as a \"crypto Whiz Kid\" also garnered attention in 2019 after winning a $4.6 million charity lunch with Warren Buffett.The convergence of crypto and conceptual art, exemplified by Sun’s multimillion-dollar banana purchase, reflects the shifting dynamics of modern wealth and investment. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin cement their place in mainstream finance, high-profile figures like Sun are redefining how—and where—value is created and celebrated.Also read | HEG jumps over 6% after Rs 172 crore block deal; eyes further gains on China stimulus hopes(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

  "title": "CNBC Daily Open : U . S . exceptionalism seems difficult to dismiss for now",
  "content": " This report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 rose 0.4% for its sixth straight day of wins. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.37% even as the country's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. OPEC+ extends oil supply cutThe OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations will postpone plans to roll back several formal and voluntary production cuts into 2026, according to delegate sources, who could only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks. Oil prices ticked up slightly on the news. An unlikely endorsement for bitcoin On Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $96,500. While the initial euphoria may have been triggered by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's planned nomination of Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that bitcoin is \"a competitor for gold\" also helped sentiment. [PRO] Bitcoin is the new gold?Gold has long held a place in investors' portfolios as an asset that hedged against market swings and geopolitical instability. Now bitcoin, with its meteoric rise in popularity and price especially in recent months, might take over the role gold plays, according to strategists. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

  "content": " Hailey Welch joins a long list of famous (and infamous) people who pushed ruinous memecoin offerings. Here's a quick reminder after the launch of Hawk Tuah girl Hailey Welch's crypto: Memecoins are a dangerous investment. Credit: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images Bitcoin has just hit $100,000.Buoyed by Donald Trump's reelection and the promise of a pro-cryptocurrency administration, crypto investors are going all in on the digital currency. With the price of Bitcoin rising high, cryptocurrency is seemingly seeping back into the public consciousness after the crypto crashes of 2022.And, it appears the memecoin fad is having a resurgence right now too. On the same day Bitcoin hit its new six-figure record high, the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" girl Hailey Welch launched her own cryptocurrency token $HAWK. Upon launch, $HAWK jumped to a market cap of $500 million. Within minutes, the token crashed. Its current market cap is around $36 million. Hawk Tuah fans quickly took to social media to share how they lost thousands of dollars.Things are starting to look a lot like 2021 all over again. During the last crypto rush of 2021, some celebrities and online influencers quickly saw that there was money to be made. Some musicians, reality TV stars, and e-sports names endorsed altcoins or even went ahead and made their own branded memecoins.Cryptocurrency is a risky investment to begin with. Crypto tokens are a highly volatile speculative asset. There is currently very little governmental oversight or regulation when it comes to the crypto market. Even Bitcoin, seen as the most \"safe\" bet in the crypto world, has had major ebbs and flows. If you have to sell during one of the down periods, you might lose a chunk of change. Mashable Light Speed Furthermore, now anyone can create a crypto token. Over the past few years, there have been platforms that have helped make the process very easy. Dogecoin, easily the most popular memecoin, set a standard of success that no other memecoin has been able to replicate.Yet, the allure of making easy money and getting rich quick through crypto tokens and memecoins have drawn in lots of money from people. Back in 2021, memecoins created by celebrities and influencers were all the rage. As Mashable reported then, many turned out to be a scam.Rug pulls are quite common with memecoins, especially those created by influencers and celebrities. Here's what often happens: A famous or notable individual launches a memecoin. Their fans are encouraged to purchase to support their favorite creator while also making money for themselves. However, before the memecoin is officially launched, the memecoin creator puts aside a certain amount of tokens for themselves or their friends. They either give these out freely or provide an unadvertised pre-launch sale at well below the price that the token will go for at launch. When the token does go on sale, the public buys, pushing the value of the memecoin up. But, as soon as that happens, those who received coins at pre-launch dump their holdings for profit, plummeting its value and eventually crashing the memecoin. The celebrity or influencer's fans are often then left holding the bag, their money tied up in a now-worthless token that they will never be able to sell. It may seem obvious that one should not accept financial advice from celebrities. Way back in 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a stark warning about the speculative machinations of public figures. \"Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements,\" Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin wrote in the same statement announcing Floyd Mayweather Jr. and DJ Khaled were charged with illegally touting initial coin offerings. \"Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they’re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds.\"However, in an age or parasocial relationships, many fans feel like they can trust their favorite influencers. There's a feeling that \"they wouldn't scam me.\" But, time and time again, celebrity memecoins have failed, with insiders making money off of the influencer's fans. Tweet may have been deleted Take the aforementioned and recently launched $HAWK. In a X Spaces stream, YouTuber Coffeezilla who investigates cryptocurrency scams, confronts Welch and the developers behind her crypto token about how things played out after the launch. Its a tale we've heard before. The vast majority of the tokens were held by just a few crypto wallets before the public launch. After it launched, according to Coffeezilla, those insiders dumped the token. $HAWK's value plummeted and all of those buyers who got in at launch are left with a significant financial loss.There is no recourse for those memecoin buyers. There are no refunds, no way for them to get their money back. Most memecoins have zero utility, so there's no use case for the tokens either. The only way they're getting back what they put in is if Welch and her team can somehow convince another group of suckers to put their money into this worthless token.Hopefully, after reading this, you won't be one of those suckers.

  "title": "Trump attends Fox Nation event , receives  Patriot of the Year  award",
  "content": " Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. GREENVALE, N.Y. — Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election. Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation’s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform. “I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. “It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID. Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows. “Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” — a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary. Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well. The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect. The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.\" He played “YMCA” — the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies — and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon. Later, he donned an orange safety vest — a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years. Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again. Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends. Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal. On Thursday, he was more magnanimous. “You have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.\" Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month. This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago. ___ AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

  "content": " US President-elect Donald Trump named former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House \"AI and Crypto Czar\". The wealthy tech entrepreneur will take on a newly created role advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. \"David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,\" Mr Trump said in a social media post. \"He will safeguard Free Speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,\" he added. Mr Sacks will also lead a presidential council of advisers on science and technology, according to Mr Trump. David Sacks will lead a presidential council of advisers on science and technology The entrepreneur, whose wealth has been estimated in the billions of dollars, is considered part of a so-called \"PayPal Mafia\" cadre of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The group was part of that company's founding era and members have thrown their clout behind conservative political policies and candidates. Mr Sacks backed JD Vance as Mr Trump's running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Mr Vance on his podcast in the process. After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Mr Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft. Mr Sacks, who like Mr Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups. Bitcoin breached $100,000 before dipping back below the symbolically important level. The digital asset has now soared more than 50% since the election of Mr Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world\". The historic level was broken after Mr Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator. Mr Atkins \"is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform. \"Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,\" she added. Musk meetings Mr Musk met with US politicians yesterday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration. Mr Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy. During Donald Trump's election campaign, Elon Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Mr Musk's star power and intense influence in Mr Trump's inner circle bring political clout. During Mr Trump's election campaign, Mr Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion. This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs - something that has never garnered strong political backing. Mr Musk's new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire. Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Mr Musk's favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin. US Ambassador to China pick Mr Trump also named political ally and former Georgia senator David Perdue as his pick to be ambassador to China, a key trade partner the Republican has promised to impose punishing tariffs on. \"Tonight, I am announcing that former US Senator, David Perdue, has accepted my appointment as the next United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China,\" Mr Trump wrote on social media. Mr Perdue, 74, a business executive and politician, served as a senator for Georgia from 2015 to 2021, and failed in a bid for governor of the state in 2022. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr Perdue will play a key role in managing the relationship between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies. A Mr Trump ally, he backed the former president's false claims regarding alleged fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which the billionaire Republican lost to Joe Biden. "

  "content": " US stocks rose Friday after a report showed a healthy jobs market and Paris rallied as President Emmanuel Macron vowed to serve out his full term and end France's political crisis.Most other stock markets were pulled higher in their wake. But oil fell and Bitcoin pulled back under $100,000 after hitting records Thursday.The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, higher than analysts' expectations, and up from a revised 36,000 in October, said the Department of Labor.\"The US jobs market has emphatically rebounded following October's disappointing data,\" said Neal Keane, head of global sales trading at ADSS.October's figures had been depressed by hurricanes and a dockworkers strike, and November's increases may have been exaggerated by the end of a strike at Boeing and by retail hiring ahead of the holiday season.US stock futures jumped in pre-market trading after the report, but gave back some of those gains.Investors are mostly betting that November's numbers, while comforting, are probably not strong enough to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again later this month.\"Investors needed a reassuring jobs report and that's exactly what they got,\" said eToro analyst Bret Kenwell. \"The market still favors a rate cut from the Fed later this month and this report may not change that expectation.\"- Paris markets rise after Macron speech -The Paris stock market was up 1.4 percent in mid-afternoon trading, on \"hope that President Emmanuel Macron will serve out his term and that a (French) budget can be passed in the coming weeks\", noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Macron on Friday was holding talks with French political leaders on the left and right as he seeks to quickly name a new prime minister after Michel Barnier's government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote.Macron adopted a defiant tone in an address to the nation Thursday evening, just 24 hours after parliament voted out Barnier over his 2025 budget plan, which included unpopular austerity measures forced through without a vote, using special powers.The luxury sector benefitted also from hopes of a pickup in Chinese demand. Gucci owner Kering topped the Paris CAC 40 as its shares gained more than five percent, while LVMH rose more than 3 percent.Frankfurt and other continental markets were also higher, though not by as much, and London little changed. In Asia, shares in Seoul sank more than one percent and the won weakened to about 1,420 per dollar as lawmakers prepared to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol's dramatic, short-lived martial law this week.While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing.On Friday the head of Yoon's ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country.Hong Kong and Shanghai rallied as investors grew hopeful of fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week.That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that China's near two-year growth slowdown could soon end.Bitcoin was hovering around $98,000, after having blasted to the historic peak of $103,800 Thursday on news that US President-elect Donald Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to head the nation's markets regulator.Oil prices slipped as OPEC+'s decision to extend supply cuts failed to assuage concerns about coming excess supply.\"Concerns about oversupply and muted global growth remain at the forefront\" of the energy market, said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at City Index. - Key figures around 1435 GMT -New York - Dow: UP 0.2 percent at 44,857.71 pointsNew York - S&P 500: UP 0.3 percent at 6,092.33 New York - Nasdaq Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 19,766.54Paris - CAC 40: UP 1.4 percent at 7,432.86Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.2 percent at 20,403.74London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 8,340.34 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.8 percent at 39,091.17 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.6 percent at 19,865.85 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.1 percent at 3,404.08 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0583 from $1.0591 on ThursdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2772 from $1.2760Dollar/yen: DOWN at 149.44 yen from 150.09 yen Euro/pound: DOWN at 82.89 from 82.97 penceWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.1 percent at $67.55 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 1.0 percent at $71.36 per barrelgv/jj GET MORE LOCAL NEWS.

  "content": "President-elect Trump said Thursday that venture capitalist David Sacks will serve as the White House artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency czar.In the newly created role, Sacks will lead the administration’s policy on AI and crypto, which will include developing a legal framework for the crypto industry, Trump said in a Truth Social post.“David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” the president-elect said. “He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Sacks will also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, Trump said.“David has the knowledge, business experience, intelligence, and pragmatism to MAKE AMERICA GREAT in these two critical technologies,” he added.Sacks was an early member of PayPal alongside tech mogul and key Trump ally Elon Musk. The two are part of a larger group of tech founders, including former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, often referred to as the PayPal Mafia.The new position, along with several of Trump’s recent Cabinet appointments, signal his relatively new embrace of crypto. Despite once dismissing crypto as a “scam,” Trump courted the industry during the election and declared that he would make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Trump also announced on Thursday that former Securities and Exchanger Commissioner Paul Atkins would return to lead the agency in his administration — a move that was widely celebrated by the crypto industry. Atkins currently serves as co-chair of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance. He will replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been a key source of frustration for the crypto industry.The price of bitcoin has surged in the wake of Trump’s win last month, surpassing $100,000 for the first time Wednesday. The president-elect took credit for the milestone in a post on Truth Social, saying, “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!”Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

  "title": "Mo  Money Mo  Problems : More on the Changes to the UCC Definitions of Money – UCC 9 - 102 ( a )( 54A ) – Part Four | Cadwalader , Wickersham & Taft LLP",
  "content": " The following article is part four of our series on the 2022 Amendments to the UCC. You can find the previous articles here. Our last article explored the amendments to the main definition of “money” in Article 1 of the UCC. We promised to look at the amended money-related definitions in Article 9 in another article. Well, here we go. UCC Article 9 (Secured Transactions) did not have its own definition of “money” before the 2022 Amendments. Now the 2022 Amendments have added a definition, which is basically the same as the Article 1 definition (i.e., “a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government”), except that the Article 9 definition excludes from the definition of money (i) a deposit account and (ii) money in electronic form that cannot be subjected to control under Section 9-105A.[1] The reason for excluding deposit accounts is because of the changes to the definition of “money” in Article 1 and because the UCC already provides for how a deposit account can be secured. The reason for excluding money in electronic form that cannot be subject to control from the Article 9 definition is that such money is not something that can be secured like other money—it would be a general intangible under Article 9.[2] But recent developments in the market potentially complicate what is deemed to be a “deposit account.” Major banks (such as JPMorgan, read more here and here] and Citibank) have implemented permissioned blockchain solutions permitting their customers to transact with funds on deposit via tokenized coins. While bank regulators might regard bank deposits as a kind of money,[3] what about the UCC? Are deposit tokens “money” under the new Article 9 definition? The answer turns on whether or not such deposit tokens are “deposit accounts,” and would therefore be excluded from Article 9 “money.” And, as with so much in the 2022 Amendments, the law looks to the technology for answers. For example, let’s say that Bank A creates a “Bank A Coin” token for deposited funds. Further, let’s say that the permissioned blockchain system where Bank A Coin resides functions, not only as a payment rail, but also as Bank A’s deposit account ledger itself. On those facts, Bank A Coin would seem to be a deposit account, analogous to a deposit on a traditional off-chain ledger. But what if Bank A Coin was just a tokenized representation of a deposit held in a traditional ledger off-chain, a kind of shadow token. Would Bank A Coin be a deposit account in that case? Less clear. Even if Bank A Coin is not a deposit account, though, does it pass muster under the other tests for Article 9 “money” that are inherited from Article 1? In particular, would the Bank A Coin be currently “authorized” or “adopted” by a government as a medium of exchange? Even if Bank A obtained approval for the Bank A Coin solution from its prudential banking regulator, for UCC purposes, without some kind of new regulation from the Department of Treasury blessing such approval as being tantamount to governmental authorization or adoption of the Bank A Coin, the Bank A Coin would not be deemed money under the UCC. And that means that, unless things change, from an Article 9 perspective the Bank A Coin would potentially be subject to the provisions of Article 12 (see below). The second exclusion in the Article 9 definition deals with “control”. We are familiar with possessory control of tangible money (e.g., put bills and coins under your mattress) and Section 9-104 control of deposit accounts (DACAs, anyone?). But the 2022 Amendments to Article 9 add a new set of principles for taking control of “electronic money.” (The 2022 Amendments define “electronic money” as, naturally, “money in electronic form”[4]). These control principles for electronic money are set out in new Section 9-105A, and track the rules created under Article 12 for control of “controllable electronic records” (“CERs”). Such control principles reference three powers: they require the electronic money (or a logically related record or system) to give the controlling party (i) the power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit of the electronic money, (ii) the exclusive power to prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the benefit of the electronic money, and (iii) the exclusive power to transfer control of the electronic money to another person.[5] (You can find some of our deeper dives into the concepts of control and the nuts and bolts of Article 12 here and here. If these rules for control strike you as kind of open-ended, that is exactly their intent. The 2022 Amendments seek to be technology-neutral, and once again demand those interpreting the law to look to the tech. In other words, when money that is not excluded from Article 9’s definition is subjected to control pursuant to Section 9-105A, lawyers will have to look under the hood of technological control mechanisms—how crypto wallets work, how tokens are programmed, how blockchain protocols are governed, and so on—to figure out if tokens like Bank A Coin are capable of being “controlled”, and thus can be considered “money” under Article 9. Why bother with all this?” After all, Bitcoin is not considered “money” for UCC purposes, and stablecoins like UST or USDC are not considered money either (they’re probably best classified as CERs). The reason all of this matters is because UCC characterizations of assets are not optional— every asset must be defined as one thing or another. And it is important to understand whether the cryptocurrency token you are dealing with is or is not “money” under Article 9 because the answer can have serious knock-on ramifications. For example, even though one token might look identical to another technologically, how the tokens are characterized under Article 9 makes a difference in how to perfect a security interest by control over that token. “Control” for electronic money is different from “control” for deposit accounts, which in turn is different from “control” for uncertificated securities, for electronic chattel paper, for transferable records, for CERs, and so on. In sum, you need to take the time to understand which rule book applies. One additional sticky wicket regarding “money” in Article 9 exists—the question of “monetary obligations.” That sneaky phrase shows up in some places in the UCC and not in others. Importantly, “accounts” and “payment intangibles” are defined under Article 9 as monetary obligations. Crucially, however, the “money” that may constitute part of such “monetary obligations” is the Article 1 definition of “money” (not the Article 9 definition “money”).[6] Meaning that “monetary obligations” does not exclude deposit accounts or non-controllable electronic forms of money. Here’s how that works—imagine a receivable that is denominated, not in dollars, but in Bank A Coin. That receivable could be a monetary obligation and therefore an “account” or “payment intangible,” even if Bank A Coin were deemed a “deposit account” and therefore in and of itself not “money” under Article 9.[7] On the other hand, if the receivable were payable in Bitcoin or USDC (i.e., CERs), then that receivable could not constitute a “monetary obligation,” because Bitcoin and USDC are not money under Article 1. And, for purposes of Article 9, those receivables would not be “accounts” or “payment intangibles.” They would be something else. Finally, by following the differences in the definitions of “money” in the UCC and considering whether something can be a “monetary obligation,” you can go even further into the weeds. For example, “instruments,” like negotiable instruments, must evidence the right to a “monetary obligation,”[8] but the UCC definition of “letter of credit” only requires payment or delivery of “an item of value”—not necessarily money.[9] The landscape of digital asset transactions is evolving rapidly. Questions of which types of such tokens or cryptocurrencies would be considered “money” under the 2022 Amendments (and which are not) are important questions and can be quite complex. And, it is important to get the answers right so as to apply the appropriate rules for transacting with them. As more different types of “money” get invented for use on-chain, the more urgent it becomes to find answers to these questions. The Notorious B.I.G. may not be your go-to authority for UCC analysis. But in this case, you’ve got to admit that he’s on to something: I don't know what they want from me It's like the more money we come across The more problems we see...[10] [1] UCC (Amended) §9-102(a)(54A).

  "title": "Trump names David Sacks as White House AI and crypto czar",
  "content": " On the AI front, venture capitalist David Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Bloomberg Donald Trump says he is selecting venture capitalist David Sacks of Craft Ventures LLC to serve as his artificial intelligence and crypto czar, a newly created position that underscores the president-elect’s intent to boost two rapidly developing industries.“David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump said that Sacks would also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.In Sacks, Trump is tapping one of his most prominent Silicon Valley supporters and fundraisers for a prime position in his administration. Sacks played a key role in bolstering Trump’s fundraising among technology industry donors, including co-hosting an event at his San Francisco home in June, with tickets at $300,000 a head.He is also closely associated with Vice President-elect JD Vance, the investor-turned-Ohio senator.Story continues below AdvertisementSacks is a venture capitalist and part of Silicon Valley’s “PayPal Mafia.” He first made his name in the technology industry during a stint as the chief operating officer of PayPal, the payments company whose founders in the late 1990s included billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and investor Peter Thiel. After it was sold to eBay, Sacks turned to Hollywood, where he produced the 2005 satire Thank You for Smoking.Back in Silicon Valley, he founded workplace communications company Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion. He founded his own venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in 2017 and has invested in Musk-owned businesses, including SpaceX.Sacks said on a recent episode of his All-In podcast that a “key man” clause in the agreements of his venture firm’s legal documents would likely prevent him from taking a full-time position, but he might consider an advisory role in the new administration.A Craft spokeswoman said Sacks would not be leaving Craft.In his post, Trump said Sacks “will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.”Protecting free speech is a keen interest of Sacks. He regularly speaks about “woke” interests that try to muzzle unpopular opinions and positions.Crypto CzarThe new post is expected to help spearhead the crypto industry deregulation Trump promised on the campaign trail. The role is expected to provide cryptocurrency advocates a direct line to the White House and serve as a liaison between Trump, Congress and the federal agencies that interface with digital assets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Trump heavily campaigned on supporting crypto, after previously disparaging digital assets during his first White House term, saying their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The president-elect on Thursday said Sacks would “work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.”During the campaign, Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference, accepted crypto campaign donations and met with executives from Bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges multiple times.Trump’s desire to give priority to the digital asset industry is also reflected in his close allies and cabinet selections, including his Commerce secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, and Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent.AI TechOn the AI front, Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Sacks is poised to be at the front lines in determining how the federal government both adopts AI and regulates its use as advances in the technology and adoption by consumers pose a wide array of benefits as well as risks touching on national security, privacy, jobs and other areas.The president-elect has expressed both awe at the power of AI technology as well as concern over the potential harms from its use. During his first term, he signed executive orders that sought to maintain US leadership in the field and directed the federal government to prioritize AI in research and development spending.As AI has become more mainstream in recent years and with Congress slow to act, President Joe Biden has sought to fill that void. Biden signed an executive order in 2023 that establishes security and privacy protections and requires developers to safety-test new models, casting the sweeping regulatory order as necessary to safeguard consumers.A number of technology giants have also agreed to adopt a set of voluntary safeguards which call for them to test AI systems for discriminatory tendencies or security flaws and to share those results.Trump has vowed to repeal Biden’s order. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform dismissed Biden’s executive order as one that “hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.”Musk TiesSacks can be expected to work closely with Musk, the world’s richest person and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. Musk is also a player in the AI space with his company xAI and a chatbot named Grok — efforts which pit him against Silicon Valley’s giants — and he stands to wield significant influence within the incoming administration.The appointment won’t require Sacks to divest or publicly disclose his assets. Like Musk, Sacks will be a special government employee. He can serve a maximum of 130 days per year, with or without compensation.However, conflict of interest rules apply to special government employees, meaning Sacks will have to recuse himself from matters that could impact his holdings.Strong OpinionsSacks’s Craft Ventures is known more for enterprise software investing than for crypto, but it has made a few crypto investments, including BitGo and Bitwise. Still, Sacks has firm opinions on the sector.Speaking last month on All-In, Sacks praised a bill on crypto regulation that had passed in the US House but not the Senate earlier this year. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would regulate certain types of digital assets as a commodity, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The crypto industry basically wants a really clear line for knowing when they’re a commodity and they want commodities to be governed, like all other commodities, by the CFTC,” he said on the November podcast. He also disparaged some of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positions on crypto under its chair, Gary Gensler. “The days of Gensler terrifying crypto companies,” he said. “Those days are about to be over.”Earlier this week, Trump nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.

  "title": "Trump appoints former PayPal COO David Sacks as AI and crypto czar",
  "content": " WASHINGTON (Reuters): US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, another step toward overhauling US policy. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,” Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump’s incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump’s tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around AI and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump — who once labeled crypto a scam — embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the Internet. “It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the Internet of money,” he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. You may also like "

  "content": " NewsLiveDaily Briefing: Adani Green solar project — makings of a sweetened deal In today's edition: India’s TB fight; Fadnavis’ road ahead; crypto-optimists; and more Mumbai | Updated: December 6, 2024 10:04 IST Top headlines (Dec 5) Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 (the Rule) is tailor-made for his loyalists — there are larger-than-life moments, bigger action sequences and fiery dialogues. When Arjun enters in slow motion, the theatre is filled with whoops, whistles and screams. This isn’t just the case in cinema halls in the South. Similar scenes played out in the North, particularly the heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. The reason for this “pan-India” appeal is part good old filmy masala and part business tact. Moving on to today’s edition.Big Story Amid the growing scrutiny around the Adani Group, here’s another piece of the puzzle: The Indian Express found that the Union government waived transmission charges for states buying electricity from Adani Green and Azure Power. Why? The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a public sector entity, awarded a 12 giga-watt project to Adani Green and Azure Power after it floated a tender in 2019. With distribution companies (DISCOMs) not interested in buying, the Union government sought to sweeten the deal. The YSRCP-led Andhra Pradesh government pounced on the chance and signed a deal with the SECI to buy power within hours of the waiver. Questions galore: The deal has come under scrutiny following an indictment by US prosecutors. They charged the Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar and six others for their roles in a multi-billion dollar scheme to obtain funds from investors allegedly based on misleading statements. Among those, were the false statements made to investors over alleged bribery to the SECI. Interestingly, these bribes were allegedly paid when SECI was unable to sign agreements with state DISCOMs. Only in Express India’s fight against Tuberculosis saw some bright spots last month with the World Health Organisation noting the 18% dip in cases and a 24% reduction in deaths over the past 10 years. India was above the global average in both metrics. The government has had its work cut out: eliminating TB by 2025. However, an investigation by The Indian Express found that in the mission to end TB, states now face one battle–the shortage of drugs. From the Front Page A patch-up: Amid the thaw in ties between India and China, the two sides reflected on the “lessons learnt” from the military standoff in eastern Ladakh. This comes days after the troop disengagement at two friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Up next: a meeting of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. ‘T20 over, now Test’: Back at the top job, Devendra Fadnavis’ reversal of fortune may have felt nothing short of vindication. The road ahead, however, isn’t easy. From keeping the ruling alliance together to the economic problems of a debt-ridden state, there’s many a challenge waiting for the newly minted Chief Minister. Tune in to the ‘3 Things’ podcast for more on Fadnavis and what sets him apart. Must Read In this week’s Dis/Agree column, we offer two takes on how New Delhi must engage with Dhaka amid the mounting worry over the violence against minorities in Bangladesh. Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal argues why India must flag anti-Hindu violence. “Muhammad Yunus’s interim set-up has been underplaying the extent of pressures on Hindu Bangladeshis, and this calls into question its willingness to seriously address the issue,” he writes. Ria Chakrabarty, a senior policy director at Hindus for Human Rights, makes a case for exercising caution. “While the Bangladeshi interim government should do more to address anti-Hindu violence, it should be noted that the misinformation spewing from India and others are escalating the crisis,” she writes. Outrage: The parents of students at the Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, located within the IIT Madras campus, are livid. It seems the school conducted “product testing” on kids without prior consent. The product in question? A smart shoe insole and smartwatch. The students were made to carry out physical activities, which left them “unusually tired”. And Finally… Crypto enthusiasts had a field day as Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time on December 4. What’s behind the surge? Donald Trump’s reelection. His administrative picks to run the government have optimists hoping for regulatory lenience towards cryptocurrency.

  "content": " Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. GREENVALE, N.Y. — Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election. Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation’s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform. “I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. “It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID. Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows. “Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” — a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary. Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well. The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect. The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.\" He played “YMCA” — the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies — and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon. Later, he donned an orange safety vest — a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years. Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again. Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends. Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal. On Thursday, he was more magnanimous. “You have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.\" Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month. This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago. ___ AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

  "title": "wazir x : Crypto chaos : WazirX hack leaves investors in financial turmoil",
  "content": "The automobile spare parts dealer in Patna got worried when he glanced at the alerts on his phone on July 18. News portals were reporting that India’s cryptocurrency exchange WazirX had been hacked. At first, he thought that meant a “technical glitch” and things would get back to normal. The full extent of his misfortune was yet to be revealed.Tired of too many ads? Remove Ads“My cousin told me some Rs 2,000 crore had been stolen from the company,” said the 32-year-old man. “I immediately rushed to withdraw my Rs 7 lakh investment on WazirX but it was too late--no transactions were allowed.”The prospect of never being able to get his money back has caused sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional distress and setbacks in business. At home, he pretends nothing has happened. “My wife thinks I do some stock market trade,” he said. “She doesn’t understand crypto stuff--she thinks we are rich.”Crypto TrackerPowered ByHe dwells on what might have been.“Every day, I take a pen and paper (to calculate) and tell my co-worker that today the value of my crypto would have been Rs 25 lakh,” he said. “(Auto) agency guys would have given us so much business on such credit.”He’s not alone. About 15 million users of WazirX were victims of one of the largest cyberattacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in July, leading to the theft of investor holdings worth $235 million or nearly half of the platform's estimated reserves. Since then, the remaining funds on the platform have been frozen and trading has been halted.ET spoke to about a dozen people who had invested between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 crore on the platform. Many recounted tales of financial distress--individuals driven into debt, some having to flee their villages and others grappling with suicidal thoughts.Where is the money?Somewhere the thief (or thieves) who masterminded this heist is watching the tokens swell in value in the ongoing crypto bull run. As per an analysis of Lookonchain data, that $235 million will now be valued at about $330 million.Crypto prices have skyrocketed in the past month following the victory of Donald Trump—a sceptic-turned-champion—in the US elections. In the past month, crypto market cap has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion, surpassing that of companies like Apple and Nvidia.Netherlands-based blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Intelligence recently said that the WazirX thief has almost finished laundering the stolen funds via TornadoCash. Only $6 million of Ether (ETH) remains traceable. TornadoCash is an open source, non-custodial, fully decentralised cryptocurrency platform that shuffles crypto tokens, making it difficult to track the source of funds and recover any stolen money.The rebalancingOwned by Singapore-based Zettai Pte Ltd, WazirX was once the largest Indian exchange, holding over $535 million in investor assets. Investors have been incensed at the manner in which the crisis has been handled, with much of the anger directed at cofounder and CEO Nischal Shetty.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsTo be sure, on November 6, WazirX announced that it plans to return 52% of total creditor claims through remaining liquid assets ($284 million) while the remaining 48% will be distributed over the coming years from future profits and recoveries of the stolen assets. It must be noted that the unstolen liquid funds are today valued at $577 million.But WazirX has set a cut-off of 1 pm India time on July 18 to determine claim value. This has enraged investors as their holdings would have surged in value since then. For instance, when WazirX was drained, Shiba Inu (SHIB), was the largest category token stolen by value. Since then, this has grown to $173 million from $102 million. Similarly, Pepe’s value has grown from $7.6 million to $14 million.It should be noted that Bitcoin (BTC) has been the biggest gainer, soaring 60% in value since the hack. But BTC was not stolen by the hacker because the underlying blockhain’s design makes it hard to compromise. Therefore, BTC investors on WazirX are fuming over why they must pare their gains due to the company’s lack of security.Also Read: Crypto’s legal tangles seem as mystifying as digital asset itself“If the platform undergoes restructuring or liquidation, all users’ claims are treated equally, with available assets distributed proportionally,” a WazirX spokesperson told ET.Zettai is undergoing a restructuring programme under the Singapore High Court and the scheme requires approval by a minimum 75% of creditors.WazirX and its third-party custody solutions partner Liminal Custody are at loggerheads, accusing each other over vulnerabilities in systems that were exploited by the hacker. WazirX blamed Liminal and terminated its contract with the custody and wallet infrastructure platform. Meanwhile, through an independent audit, Liminal showed that it’s merely a software provider and did not have any control over WazirX’s funds.Pressing questionsSince the incident, serious concerns have been raised about WazirX’s conduct by the investor community, crypto experts and blockchain security firms.“The two most alarming questions, which Nischal Shetty has consistently failed to address are, one--why, for all these years, were investors not informed that the ownership of the company was disputed between WazirX and Binance?” said Romy Johnson, a leading representative of the WazirX investor community. “Second—and perhaps more troubling—why did WazirX store $235 million worth of tokens in a single wallet while spreading $300 million across 240,000 wallets? Was this an open invitation for hackers to strike?”WazirX said handling thousands of wallets is “normal” for large exchanges.Also Read: WazirX suffers security breach; $235 million worth of funds movedIn 2019, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, announced that it had acquired WazirX. However, Binance now claims the deal never materialised due to Zettai’s failure to meet its obligations. This dispute is currently being litigated in a Singapore court, leaving investors in a lurch.Johnson questioned why WazirX had failed to maintain surplus reserves to handle crises.“The hack amount is too huge and large exchanges cannot maintain such a high surplus ratio,” WazirX said in response to this.Investor Johnson also sought clarification on Shetty’s funds and queried the cut-off date.“What happened to Nischal Shetty’s personal wealth or the company’s past profits?” he said. “What is the rationale behind selecting July 18 as the cut-off date for liabilities?”Johnson also asked why investors’ ₹100 crore was being used as a crisis management fund.“The lack of transparency and accountability is deeply troubling,” Johnson added, highlighting how these unresolved issues have undermined confidence.The investor community is demanding immediate action and clearer communication to safeguard the interests of those affected.Legal recourseScores of first information reports (FIRs), lawsuits, petitions to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), letters to the finance ministry, CERT-In and hundreds of daily social media posts appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Although crypto isn’t illegal, it isn’t recognised as an investment class under Indian law. But crypto trading income is taxed under the Income Tax Act. CERT-In is the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, the nodal agency on cyber security.Last month, the Delhi Police special cell arrested SK Masud Alam of West Bengal, accusing him of selling a fake login to the thief.“Our police départements are unequipped to investigate such a sophisticated cybercrime… hence this is just scratching the surface,” said a lead lawyer in the case. “Neither can law enforce its weight because India does not recognise crypto as a legitimate investment class. It is only taxed as a virtual digital asset under the Income Tax Act. Only CERT-In is required to investigate the case as a cyberattack under the Information Technology Act.”Also Read: WazirX parent looking for ‘white knights’ to rescue crypto exchange"

  "content": "United States president-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he was appointing former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as his \"White House AI and Crypto Czar,\" another step towards overhauling the country's cryptocurrency policy.\"He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,\" Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social, without saying whether \"czar\" was an official title.The crypto czar and other officials in Trump's incoming administration, such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council.Trump's tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying the US would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules.Property in 2025 & Bitcoin reaches US$100,000Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry.Trump — who once labelled crypto a scam — embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make US the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.Bitcoin broke US$100,000 ($155,360) for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets.Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news of Sacks' appointment as extremely bullish. \"David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as Solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,\" he said.A member of the 'Paypal Mafia'Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm acquired by eBay in 2002.Sacks is considered a member of the 'PayPal Mafia' — former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency.Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users.He was an early advocate of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionising the internet.\"It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money.\"Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology."

  "title": "Bitcoin hits $100 , 000 for the first time : 3 things to know : NPR",
  "content": " SCOTT DETROW, HOST: Bitcoin just crossed a big milestone. It hit over $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, and it's pretty remarkable for a cryptocurrency that was created just over 15 years ago. For more on this, we are joined by NPR's senior business editor, Rafael Nam. Hey, Rafael.RAFAEL NAM, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So what has led bitcoin to this milestone at this particular moment?NAM: In short, the election of Donald Trump as president. Just a few years ago, Trump called cryptocurrencies a scam, but he's changed his mind. In July, when he gave a speech at a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, he wanted to make one thing clear.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: This afternoon, I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world, and we'll get it done.(CHEERING)NAM: And Trump went on to make several promises, the main one being that he would appoint regulators who would be a lot friendlier to the industry than the current administration. So when Trump won the election, bitcoin just took off. To give you a perspective, bitcoin was trading just under $70,000 on Election Day. And now, a month later, it's trading at six figures. That's a gain of over 40%.DETROW: I think there are a lot of signs that these promises won Trump a lot of votes. So he hasn't taken office yet, but so far, at least, is he delivering on the promises?NAM: He is. Bitcoin hit the $100,000 milestone just hours after he nominated Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's the agency that has oversight of financial markets, and Atkins has experience as a financial regulator. But the big reason why crypto investors are so excited is that Atkins backs cryptocurrencies. He now runs a consultancy with crypto companies as clients. And if confirmed, he would replace the current chair, who is very skeptical of cryptocurrencies.DETROW: There is some reason for that skepticism, though - right? - because cryptocurrencies has a sketchy past, to put it technically. And I think a lot of people probably still associate them with activities like drug trade, right?NAM: That's exactly right. That's why there's a lot of people who are very alarmed. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are widely used for all kinds of illegal activities, like you mentioned, including also ransomware, I should add. It also has a history of scams and fraud. And historically, it's been very volatile. Remember, just over two years ago, the biggest crypto exchange at the time, FTX, collapsed. And its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of fraud and is now serving a 25-year prison term. That's quite a comeback in just two years for bitcoin.DETROW: Let's go back to that first data point, though, where it is on the market. What do these big gains mean for bitcoin?NAM: Gosh, there's a lot of excitement, and it's not just Trump. Bitcoin is going more mainstream now. Cities like Detroit are now even accepting cryptocurrencies for payments, like for taxes, and many banks and trading firms are allowing people like you and me to invest in bitcoin now through these investment funds called exchange-traded funds. But again, keep in mind one thing, Scott. Bitcoin is still very young and is incredibly volatile. Yes, it does have a history of big rallies, but it also has a history of big falls.DETROW: That is NPR's Rafael Nam. Thank you so much. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

Ethereum rose beyond $3,950 for the first time since mid-March, before falling into the $3,800 zone later in the day. The crash triggered cryptocurrency liquidations worth $969 million in the last 24 hours, with $774 million in leveraged longs getting wiped out. The liquidation of overleveraged longs cooled down the market as funding rates dropped considerably. Traders interpreted this as a bullish signal, as accounts on Binance placing long positions for Bitcoin surged sharply in comparison to those betting against the asset, per the Long/Shorts Ratio. The market sentiment dropped from \"Extreme Greed\" to \"Greed,\" per the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index, alleviating fears of more correction.

  "content": " This report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 rose 0.4% for its sixth straight day of wins. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.37% even as the country's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. OPEC+ extends oil supply cutThe OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations will postpone plans to roll back several formal and voluntary production cuts into 2026, according to delegate sources, who could only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks. Oil prices ticked up slightly on the news. An unlikely endorsement for bitcoin On Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $96,500. While the initial euphoria may have been triggered by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's planned nomination of Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that bitcoin is \"a competitor for gold\" also helped sentiment. [PRO] Bitcoin is the new gold?Gold has long held a place in investors' portfolios as an asset that hedged against market swings and geopolitical instability. Now bitcoin, with its meteoric rise in popularity and price especially in recent months, might take over the role gold plays, according to strategists. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

  "title": "Trump appoints  czar  of AI and crypto policy",
  "content": " US President-elect Donald Trump named former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House \"AI and Crypto Czar\". The wealthy tech entrepreneur will take on a newly created role advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. \"David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,\" Mr Trump said in a social media post. \"He will safeguard Free Speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,\" he added. Mr Sacks will also lead a presidential council of advisers on science and technology, according to Mr Trump. David Sacks will lead a presidential council of advisers on science and technology The entrepreneur, whose wealth has been estimated in the billions of dollars, is considered part of a so-called \"PayPal Mafia\" cadre of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The group was part of that company's founding era and members have thrown their clout behind conservative political policies and candidates. Mr Sacks backed JD Vance as Mr Trump's running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Mr Vance on his podcast in the process. After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Mr Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft. Mr Sacks, who like Mr Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups. Bitcoin breached $100,000 before dipping back below the symbolically important level. The digital asset has now soared more than 50% since the election of Mr Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world\". The historic level was broken after Mr Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator. Mr Atkins \"is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform. \"Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,\" she added. Musk meetings Mr Musk met with US politicians yesterday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration. Mr Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy. During Donald Trump's election campaign, Elon Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Mr Musk's star power and intense influence in Mr Trump's inner circle bring political clout. During Mr Trump's election campaign, Mr Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion. This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs - something that has never garnered strong political backing. Mr Musk's new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire. Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Mr Musk's favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin. US Ambassador to China pick Mr Trump also named political ally and former Georgia senator David Perdue as his pick to be ambassador to China, a key trade partner the Republican has promised to impose punishing tariffs on. \"Tonight, I am announcing that former US Senator, David Perdue, has accepted my appointment as the next United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China,\" Mr Trump wrote on social media. Mr Perdue, 74, a business executive and politician, served as a senator for Georgia from 2015 to 2021, and failed in a bid for governor of the state in 2022. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr Perdue will play a key role in managing the relationship between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies. A Mr Trump ally, he backed the former president's false claims regarding alleged fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which the billionaire Republican lost to Joe Biden. "

While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected.

Sacks, 52, previously served as the chief executive officer of PayPal, which was bought by eBay in 2002, before co-founding venture capital firm Craft Ventures.Sacks, who has yet to comment on the nomination, became an important fundraiser for Trump after he endorsed the New York real estate mogul in June.Reaction to Trump's appointment was swift, with Canadian-American venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who is also a co-host of All-In, praising Sacks as the \"very best of America -- - a successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist and a brilliant technologist.\"Tyler Winklevoss, founder of Winklevoss Capital Management and Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, also said it was an \"excellent choice.\"\"David's a multiple-time tech founder with huge successes.

  "content": " WASHINGTON (Reuters): US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, another step toward overhauling US policy. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,” Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump’s incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump’s tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around AI and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump — who once labeled crypto a scam — embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the Internet. “It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the Internet of money,” he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. You may also like "

  "content": " On the AI front, venture capitalist David Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Bloomberg Donald Trump says he is selecting venture capitalist David Sacks of Craft Ventures LLC to serve as his artificial intelligence and crypto czar, a newly created position that underscores the president-elect’s intent to boost two rapidly developing industries.“David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social network.Trump said that Sacks would also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.In Sacks, Trump is tapping one of his most prominent Silicon Valley supporters and fundraisers for a prime position in his administration. Sacks played a key role in bolstering Trump’s fundraising among technology industry donors, including co-hosting an event at his San Francisco home in June, with tickets at $300,000 a head.He is also closely associated with Vice President-elect JD Vance, the investor-turned-Ohio senator.Story continues below AdvertisementSacks is a venture capitalist and part of Silicon Valley’s “PayPal Mafia.” He first made his name in the technology industry during a stint as the chief operating officer of PayPal, the payments company whose founders in the late 1990s included billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and investor Peter Thiel. After it was sold to eBay, Sacks turned to Hollywood, where he produced the 2005 satire Thank You for Smoking.Back in Silicon Valley, he founded workplace communications company Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion. He founded his own venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in 2017 and has invested in Musk-owned businesses, including SpaceX.Sacks said on a recent episode of his All-In podcast that a “key man” clause in the agreements of his venture firm’s legal documents would likely prevent him from taking a full-time position, but he might consider an advisory role in the new administration.A Craft spokeswoman said Sacks would not be leaving Craft.In his post, Trump said Sacks “will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.”Protecting free speech is a keen interest of Sacks. He regularly speaks about “woke” interests that try to muzzle unpopular opinions and positions.Crypto CzarThe new post is expected to help spearhead the crypto industry deregulation Trump promised on the campaign trail. The role is expected to provide cryptocurrency advocates a direct line to the White House and serve as a liaison between Trump, Congress and the federal agencies that interface with digital assets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Trump heavily campaigned on supporting crypto, after previously disparaging digital assets during his first White House term, saying their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The president-elect on Thursday said Sacks would “work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.”During the campaign, Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference, accepted crypto campaign donations and met with executives from Bitcoin mining companies and crypto exchanges multiple times.Trump’s desire to give priority to the digital asset industry is also reflected in his close allies and cabinet selections, including his Commerce secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, and Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent.AI TechOn the AI front, Sacks would help Trump put his imprint on an emerging technology whose popular use has exploded in recent years. Sacks is poised to be at the front lines in determining how the federal government both adopts AI and regulates its use as advances in the technology and adoption by consumers pose a wide array of benefits as well as risks touching on national security, privacy, jobs and other areas.The president-elect has expressed both awe at the power of AI technology as well as concern over the potential harms from its use. During his first term, he signed executive orders that sought to maintain US leadership in the field and directed the federal government to prioritize AI in research and development spending.As AI has become more mainstream in recent years and with Congress slow to act, President Joe Biden has sought to fill that void. Biden signed an executive order in 2023 that establishes security and privacy protections and requires developers to safety-test new models, casting the sweeping regulatory order as necessary to safeguard consumers.A number of technology giants have also agreed to adopt a set of voluntary safeguards which call for them to test AI systems for discriminatory tendencies or security flaws and to share those results.Trump has vowed to repeal Biden’s order. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform dismissed Biden’s executive order as one that “hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.”Musk TiesSacks can be expected to work closely with Musk, the world’s richest person and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. Musk is also a player in the AI space with his company xAI and a chatbot named Grok — efforts which pit him against Silicon Valley’s giants — and he stands to wield significant influence within the incoming administration.The appointment won’t require Sacks to divest or publicly disclose his assets. Like Musk, Sacks will be a special government employee. He can serve a maximum of 130 days per year, with or without compensation.However, conflict of interest rules apply to special government employees, meaning Sacks will have to recuse himself from matters that could impact his holdings.Strong OpinionsSacks’s Craft Ventures is known more for enterprise software investing than for crypto, but it has made a few crypto investments, including BitGo and Bitwise. Still, Sacks has firm opinions on the sector.Speaking last month on All-In, Sacks praised a bill on crypto regulation that had passed in the US House but not the Senate earlier this year. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would regulate certain types of digital assets as a commodity, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The crypto industry basically wants a really clear line for knowing when they’re a commodity and they want commodities to be governed, like all other commodities, by the CFTC,” he said on the November podcast. He also disparaged some of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s positions on crypto under its chair, Gary Gensler. “The days of Gensler terrifying crypto companies,” he said. “Those days are about to be over.”Earlier this week, Trump nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.

  "title": "Mo  Money Mo  Problems : More on the Changes to the UCC Definitions of Money – UCC 9 - 102 ( a )( 54A ) – Part Four | Cadwalader , Wickersham & Taft LLP",
  "content": " The following article is part four of our series on the 2022 Amendments to the UCC. You can find the previous articles here. Our last article explored the amendments to the main definition of “money” in Article 1 of the UCC. We promised to look at the amended money-related definitions in Article 9 in another article. Well, here we go. UCC Article 9 (Secured Transactions) did not have its own definition of “money” before the 2022 Amendments. Now the 2022 Amendments have added a definition, which is basically the same as the Article 1 definition (i.e., “a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government”), except that the Article 9 definition excludes from the definition of money (i) a deposit account and (ii) money in electronic form that cannot be subjected to control under Section 9-105A.[1] The reason for excluding deposit accounts is because of the changes to the definition of “money” in Article 1 and because the UCC already provides for how a deposit account can be secured. The reason for excluding money in electronic form that cannot be subject to control from the Article 9 definition is that such money is not something that can be secured like other money—it would be a general intangible under Article 9.[2] But recent developments in the market potentially complicate what is deemed to be a “deposit account.” Major banks (such as JPMorgan, read more here and here] and Citibank) have implemented permissioned blockchain solutions permitting their customers to transact with funds on deposit via tokenized coins. While bank regulators might regard bank deposits as a kind of money,[3] what about the UCC? Are deposit tokens “money” under the new Article 9 definition? The answer turns on whether or not such deposit tokens are “deposit accounts,” and would therefore be excluded from Article 9 “money.” And, as with so much in the 2022 Amendments, the law looks to the technology for answers. For example, let’s say that Bank A creates a “Bank A Coin” token for deposited funds. Further, let’s say that the permissioned blockchain system where Bank A Coin resides functions, not only as a payment rail, but also as Bank A’s deposit account ledger itself. On those facts, Bank A Coin would seem to be a deposit account, analogous to a deposit on a traditional off-chain ledger. But what if Bank A Coin was just a tokenized representation of a deposit held in a traditional ledger off-chain, a kind of shadow token. Would Bank A Coin be a deposit account in that case? Less clear. Even if Bank A Coin is not a deposit account, though, does it pass muster under the other tests for Article 9 “money” that are inherited from Article 1? In particular, would the Bank A Coin be currently “authorized” or “adopted” by a government as a medium of exchange? Even if Bank A obtained approval for the Bank A Coin solution from its prudential banking regulator, for UCC purposes, without some kind of new regulation from the Department of Treasury blessing such approval as being tantamount to governmental authorization or adoption of the Bank A Coin, the Bank A Coin would not be deemed money under the UCC. And that means that, unless things change, from an Article 9 perspective the Bank A Coin would potentially be subject to the provisions of Article 12 (see below). The second exclusion in the Article 9 definition deals with “control”. We are familiar with possessory control of tangible money (e.g., put bills and coins under your mattress) and Section 9-104 control of deposit accounts (DACAs, anyone?). But the 2022 Amendments to Article 9 add a new set of principles for taking control of “electronic money.” (The 2022 Amendments define “electronic money” as, naturally, “money in electronic form”[4]). These control principles for electronic money are set out in new Section 9-105A, and track the rules created under Article 12 for control of “controllable electronic records” (“CERs”). Such control principles reference three powers: they require the electronic money (or a logically related record or system) to give the controlling party (i) the power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit of the electronic money, (ii) the exclusive power to prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the benefit of the electronic money, and (iii) the exclusive power to transfer control of the electronic money to another person.[5] (You can find some of our deeper dives into the concepts of control and the nuts and bolts of Article 12 here and here. If these rules for control strike you as kind of open-ended, that is exactly their intent. The 2022 Amendments seek to be technology-neutral, and once again demand those interpreting the law to look to the tech. In other words, when money that is not excluded from Article 9’s definition is subjected to control pursuant to Section 9-105A, lawyers will have to look under the hood of technological control mechanisms—how crypto wallets work, how tokens are programmed, how blockchain protocols are governed, and so on—to figure out if tokens like Bank A Coin are capable of being “controlled”, and thus can be considered “money” under Article 9. Why bother with all this?” After all, Bitcoin is not considered “money” for UCC purposes, and stablecoins like UST or USDC are not considered money either (they’re probably best classified as CERs). The reason all of this matters is because UCC characterizations of assets are not optional— every asset must be defined as one thing or another. And it is important to understand whether the cryptocurrency token you are dealing with is or is not “money” under Article 9 because the answer can have serious knock-on ramifications. For example, even though one token might look identical to another technologically, how the tokens are characterized under Article 9 makes a difference in how to perfect a security interest by control over that token. “Control” for electronic money is different from “control” for deposit accounts, which in turn is different from “control” for uncertificated securities, for electronic chattel paper, for transferable records, for CERs, and so on. In sum, you need to take the time to understand which rule book applies. One additional sticky wicket regarding “money” in Article 9 exists—the question of “monetary obligations.” That sneaky phrase shows up in some places in the UCC and not in others. Importantly, “accounts” and “payment intangibles” are defined under Article 9 as monetary obligations. Crucially, however, the “money” that may constitute part of such “monetary obligations” is the Article 1 definition of “money” (not the Article 9 definition “money”).[6] Meaning that “monetary obligations” does not exclude deposit accounts or non-controllable electronic forms of money. Here’s how that works—imagine a receivable that is denominated, not in dollars, but in Bank A Coin. That receivable could be a monetary obligation and therefore an “account” or “payment intangible,” even if Bank A Coin were deemed a “deposit account” and therefore in and of itself not “money” under Article 9.[7] On the other hand, if the receivable were payable in Bitcoin or USDC (i.e., CERs), then that receivable could not constitute a “monetary obligation,” because Bitcoin and USDC are not money under Article 1. And, for purposes of Article 9, those receivables would not be “accounts” or “payment intangibles.” They would be something else. Finally, by following the differences in the definitions of “money” in the UCC and considering whether something can be a “monetary obligation,” you can go even further into the weeds. For example, “instruments,” like negotiable instruments, must evidence the right to a “monetary obligation,”[8] but the UCC definition of “letter of credit” only requires payment or delivery of “an item of value”—not necessarily money.[9] The landscape of digital asset transactions is evolving rapidly. Questions of which types of such tokens or cryptocurrencies would be considered “money” under the 2022 Amendments (and which are not) are important questions and can be quite complex. And, it is important to get the answers right so as to apply the appropriate rules for transacting with them. As more different types of “money” get invented for use on-chain, the more urgent it becomes to find answers to these questions. The Notorious B.I.G. may not be your go-to authority for UCC analysis. But in this case, you’ve got to admit that he’s on to something: I don't know what they want from me It's like the more money we come across The more problems we see...[10] [1] UCC (Amended) §9-102(a)(54A).

  "content": " NewsLiveDaily Briefing: Adani Green solar project — makings of a sweetened deal In today's edition: India’s TB fight; Fadnavis’ road ahead; crypto-optimists; and more Mumbai | Updated: December 6, 2024 10:04 IST Top headlines (Dec 5) Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 (the Rule) is tailor-made for his loyalists — there are larger-than-life moments, bigger action sequences and fiery dialogues. When Arjun enters in slow motion, the theatre is filled with whoops, whistles and screams. This isn’t just the case in cinema halls in the South. Similar scenes played out in the North, particularly the heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. The reason for this “pan-India” appeal is part good old filmy masala and part business tact. Moving on to today’s edition.Big Story Amid the growing scrutiny around the Adani Group, here’s another piece of the puzzle: The Indian Express found that the Union government waived transmission charges for states buying electricity from Adani Green and Azure Power. Why? The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a public sector entity, awarded a 12 giga-watt project to Adani Green and Azure Power after it floated a tender in 2019. With distribution companies (DISCOMs) not interested in buying, the Union government sought to sweeten the deal. The YSRCP-led Andhra Pradesh government pounced on the chance and signed a deal with the SECI to buy power within hours of the waiver. Questions galore: The deal has come under scrutiny following an indictment by US prosecutors. They charged the Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar and six others for their roles in a multi-billion dollar scheme to obtain funds from investors allegedly based on misleading statements. Among those, were the false statements made to investors over alleged bribery to the SECI. Interestingly, these bribes were allegedly paid when SECI was unable to sign agreements with state DISCOMs. Only in Express India’s fight against Tuberculosis saw some bright spots last month with the World Health Organisation noting the 18% dip in cases and a 24% reduction in deaths over the past 10 years. India was above the global average in both metrics. The government has had its work cut out: eliminating TB by 2025. However, an investigation by The Indian Express found that in the mission to end TB, states now face one battle–the shortage of drugs. From the Front Page A patch-up: Amid the thaw in ties between India and China, the two sides reflected on the “lessons learnt” from the military standoff in eastern Ladakh. This comes days after the troop disengagement at two friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Up next: a meeting of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. ‘T20 over, now Test’: Back at the top job, Devendra Fadnavis’ reversal of fortune may have felt nothing short of vindication. The road ahead, however, isn’t easy. From keeping the ruling alliance together to the economic problems of a debt-ridden state, there’s many a challenge waiting for the newly minted Chief Minister. Tune in to the ‘3 Things’ podcast for more on Fadnavis and what sets him apart. Must Read In this week’s Dis/Agree column, we offer two takes on how New Delhi must engage with Dhaka amid the mounting worry over the violence against minorities in Bangladesh. Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal argues why India must flag anti-Hindu violence. “Muhammad Yunus’s interim set-up has been underplaying the extent of pressures on Hindu Bangladeshis, and this calls into question its willingness to seriously address the issue,” he writes. Ria Chakrabarty, a senior policy director at Hindus for Human Rights, makes a case for exercising caution. “While the Bangladeshi interim government should do more to address anti-Hindu violence, it should be noted that the misinformation spewing from India and others are escalating the crisis,” she writes. Outrage: The parents of students at the Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, located within the IIT Madras campus, are livid. It seems the school conducted “product testing” on kids without prior consent. The product in question? A smart shoe insole and smartwatch. The students were made to carry out physical activities, which left them “unusually tired”. And Finally… Crypto enthusiasts had a field day as Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time on December 4. What’s behind the surge? Donald Trump’s reelection.

  "title": "Risk - wary markets count down to payrolls",
  "content": " December 06, 2024 at 12:38 am EST A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu Risk sentiment took a hit in Asia on Friday from renewed political rumblings in South Korea, rattling investors' nerves as they awaited a crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report that could alter the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month. Once markets caught word that there could be another martial law declaration in South Korea, heavy selling hammered the Korean won and the Seoul share market. The won sank by as much as 1%, the KOSPI dived 1.8% at one point and the Australian dollar, a barometer of risk appetite, was down 0.5%. South Korean authorities were quick to act. Dealers said the foreign exchange regulator is believed to have sold U.S. dollars to limit the decline in the won. That would not be surprising, since the authorities have pledged unlimited liquidity to stabilise markets and that tactic has so far been working. The country's special warfare commander also came out to say he would refuse any new order for martial law, calming nerves somewhat. While keeping a wary eye on South Korea, the market's main attention is fixed on U.S. payrolls data due for release later on Friday. Forecasts are centred on a rise of 200,000 jobs in November, rebounding from soft numbers in October that reflected the impact of hurricanes and strikes. The unemployment rate likely edged up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Markets are priced for a Goldilocks outcome: neither so strong that it would threaten the prospects of a rate cut, nor so soft that it would stir up concerns about the economy. Futures imply a 70% chance of a rate cut by the Fed on Dec. 18, suggesting the market is vulnerable to a hot jobs report, particularly after recent soft data emboldened the futures to price in an extra quarter point cut for 2025. Dollar bulls were also wary of a sharp pull-back in jobs, which could boost the outlook for rate cuts and wrong-foot a market that is overwhelmingly long the U.S. currency. Even the rally in Bitcoin is showing signs of fatigue after crossing the $100,000 level for the first time ever. It retreated as far as $92,092 before steadying at $97,444 on Friday, up 0.4% for the day and supported by Trump's appointment of former PayPal executive David Sacks to be his White House \"artificial intelligence and crypto czar\". Europe is looking ahead to a lower open with some secondary data due. EUROSTOXX 50 futures are down 0.4% and FTSE futures are 0.1% lower. U.S. stock futures are a fraction easier. In other news, Trump said he had chosen former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by deep mistrust and trade tensions. Key developments that could influence markets on Friday: -- Germany industrial output -- UK Halifax house prices -- Eurozone revised GDP for Q3 -- U.S. non farm payrolls for Nov (By Stella Qiu; Editing by Edmund Klamann) © Reuters - 2024 "

  "title": "wazir x : Crypto chaos : WazirX hack leaves investors in financial turmoil",
  "content": "The automobile spare parts dealer in Patna got worried when he glanced at the alerts on his phone on July 18. News portals were reporting that India’s cryptocurrency exchange WazirX had been hacked. At first, he thought that meant a “technical glitch” and things would get back to normal. The full extent of his misfortune was yet to be revealed.“My cousin told me some Rs 2,000 crore had been stolen from the company,” said the 32-year-old man. “I immediately rushed to withdraw my Rs 7 lakh investment on WazirX but it was too late--no transactions were allowed.”The prospect of never being able to get his money back has caused sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional distress and setbacks in business. At home, he pretends nothing has happened. “My wife thinks I do some stock market trade,” he said. “She doesn’t understand crypto stuff--she thinks we are rich.”Crypto TrackerHe dwells on what might have been.“Every day, I take a pen and paper (to calculate) and tell my co-worker that today the value of my crypto would have been Rs 25 lakh,” he said. “(Auto) agency guys would have given us so much business on such credit.”He’s not alone. About 15 million users of WazirX were victims of one of the largest cyberattacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in July, leading to the theft of investor holdings worth $235 million or nearly half of the platform's estimated reserves. Since then, the remaining funds on the platform have been frozen and trading has been halted.ET spoke to about a dozen people who had invested between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 crore on the platform. Many recounted tales of financial distress--individuals driven into debt, some having to flee their villages and others grappling with suicidal thoughts.Where is the money?Somewhere the thief (or thieves) who masterminded this heist is watching the tokens swell in value in the ongoing crypto bull run. As per an analysis of Lookonchain data, that $235 million will now be valued at about $330 million.Crypto prices have skyrocketed in the past month following the victory of Donald Trump—a sceptic-turned-champion—in the US elections. In the past month, crypto market cap has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion, surpassing that of companies like Apple and Nvidia.Netherlands-based blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Intelligence recently said that the WazirX thief has almost finished laundering the stolen funds via TornadoCash. Only $6 million of Ether (ETH) remains traceable. TornadoCash is an open source, non-custodial, fully decentralised cryptocurrency platform that shuffles crypto tokens, making it difficult to track the source of funds and recover any stolen money.The rebalancingOwned by Singapore-based Zettai Pte Ltd, WazirX was once the largest Indian exchange, holding over $535 million in investor assets. Investors have been incensed at the manner in which the crisis has been handled, with much of the anger directed at cofounder and CEO Nischal Shetty.To be sure, on November 6, WazirX announced that it plans to return 52% of total creditor claims through remaining liquid assets ($284 million) while the remaining 48% will be distributed over the coming years from future profits and recoveries of the stolen assets. It must be noted that the unstolen liquid funds are today valued at $577 million.But WazirX has set a cut-off of 1 pm India time on July 18 to determine claim value. This has enraged investors as their holdings would have surged in value since then. For instance, when WazirX was drained, Shiba Inu (SHIB), was the largest category token stolen by value. Since then, this has grown to $173 million from $102 million. Similarly, Pepe’s value has grown from $7.6 million to $14 million.It should be noted that Bitcoin (BTC) has been the biggest gainer, soaring 60% in value since the hack. But BTC was not stolen by the hacker because the underlying blockhain’s design makes it hard to compromise. Therefore, BTC investors on WazirX are fuming over why they must pare their gains due to the company’s lack of security.Also Read: Crypto’s legal tangles seem as mystifying as digital asset itself“If the platform undergoes restructuring or liquidation, all users’ claims are treated equally, with available assets distributed proportionally,” a WazirX spokesperson told ET.Zettai is undergoing a restructuring programme under the Singapore High Court and the scheme requires approval by a minimum 75% of creditors.WazirX and its third-party custody solutions partner Liminal Custody are at loggerheads, accusing each other over vulnerabilities in systems that were exploited by the hacker. WazirX blamed Liminal and terminated its contract with the custody and wallet infrastructure platform. Meanwhile, through an independent audit, Liminal showed that it’s merely a software provider and did not have any control over WazirX’s funds.Pressing questionsSince the incident, serious concerns have been raised about WazirX’s conduct by the investor community, crypto experts and blockchain security firms.“The two most alarming questions, which Nischal Shetty has consistently failed to address are, one--why, for all these years, were investors not informed that the ownership of the company was disputed between WazirX and Binance?” said Romy Johnson, a leading representative of the WazirX investor community. “Second—and perhaps more troubling—why did WazirX store $235 million worth of tokens in a single wallet while spreading $300 million across 240,000 wallets? Was this an open invitation for hackers to strike?”WazirX said handling thousands of wallets is “normal” for large exchanges.Also Read: WazirX suffers security breach; $235 million worth of funds movedIn 2019, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, announced that it had acquired WazirX. However, Binance now claims the deal never materialised due to Zettai’s failure to meet its obligations. This dispute is currently being litigated in a Singapore court, leaving investors in a lurch.Johnson questioned why WazirX had failed to maintain surplus reserves to handle crises.“The hack amount is too huge and large exchanges cannot maintain such a high surplus ratio,” WazirX said in response to this.Investor Johnson also sought clarification on Shetty’s funds and queried the cut-off date.“What happened to Nischal Shetty’s personal wealth or the company’s past profits?” he said. “What is the rationale behind selecting July 18 as the cut-off date for liabilities?”Johnson also asked why investors’ ₹100 crore was being used as a crisis management fund.“The lack of transparency and accountability is deeply troubling,” Johnson added, highlighting how these unresolved issues have undermined confidence.The investor community is demanding immediate action and clearer communication to safeguard the interests of those affected.Legal recourseScores of first information reports (FIRs), lawsuits, petitions to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), letters to the finance ministry, CERT-In and hundreds of daily social media posts appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Although crypto isn’t illegal, it isn’t recognised as an investment class under Indian law. But crypto trading income is taxed under the Income Tax Act. CERT-In is the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, the nodal agency on cyber security.Last month, the Delhi Police special cell arrested SK Masud Alam of West Bengal, accusing him of selling a fake login to the thief.“Our police départements are unequipped to investigate such a sophisticated cybercrime… hence this is just scratching the surface,” said a lead lawyer in the case. “Neither can law enforce its weight because India does not recognise crypto as a legitimate investment class. It is only taxed as a virtual digital asset under the Income Tax Act. Only CERT-In is required to investigate the case as a cyberattack under the Information Technology Act.”Also Read: WazirX parent looking for ‘white knights’ to rescue crypto exchange"

  "content": " Trump appoints 'czar' of AI and crypto policy Washington, Dec 6 (AFP) Dec 06, 2024 US President-elect Donald Trump late Thursday named former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House \"AI and Crypto Czar.\" The wealthy tech entrepreneur will take on a newly created role advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence.\"David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,\" Trump said in a social media post.\"He will safeguard Free Speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.\"Sacks will also lead a presidential council of advisors on science and technology, according to Trump.The entrepreneur, whose wealth has been estimated in the billions of dollars, is considered part of a so-called \"PayPal Mafia\" cadre of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.The group was part of that company's founding era and members have thrown their clout behind conservative political policies and candidates.Sacks backed J.D. Vance as Trump's running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Vance on his podcast in the process.After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft.Sacks, who like Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups.Bitcoin breached $100,000 on Thursday before dipping back below the symbolically important level.The digital asset has now soared more than 50 percent since the election of Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.\"The historic level was broken after Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator.Atkins \"is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform.\"Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,\" she added.- Musk meetings -Musk met with US lawmakers Thursday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration.Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy.Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Musk's star power and intense influence in Trump's inner circle bring political clout.During Trump's election campaign, Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion.This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs -- something that has never garnered strong political backing.Musk's new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire.Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Musk's favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin.

  "title": "Stock market today : Asian stocks are mixed after Wall Street falls ahead of key US jobs report",
  "content": "Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter.Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they're getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France's CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea's ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.___AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed."

  "title": "Trump talks up election victory as he receives  Patriot of the Year  award at Fox Nation event",
  "content": " By Jill Colvin, The Associated Press on December 5, 2024.FILE - Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference July 27, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)GREENVALE, N.Y. (AP) – President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday night in accepting the “Patriot of the Year” award at Fox Nation’s Patriot Awards that he has already accomplished more since his election victory than President Joe Biden has in his entire term.Trump, who has been largely ensconced at Mar-a-Lago in recent weeks as he’s been announcing job picks for his administration, traveled to New York’s Long Island for the annual awards ceremony from the Fox News streaming platform.“I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts.“It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said of his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches, complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID.Trump also noted the conversations he’s had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country’s top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows.“Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau’s trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” – a reference to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state.The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a friend of Trump’s who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary.Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well.The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. One such reunion took place onstage, as a service member was reunited with a dog he’d cared for while deployed.The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect.The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.” He played “YMCA” – the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies – and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon.Later, he donned an orange safety vest – a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage.The show was originally set to be hosted by Hegseth, who left his position at Fox when Trump tapped him to run the Pentagon – a nomination that is currently in jeopardy over allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking, which Hegseth denies.Members of the audience cheered when Hegseth appeared in a video that was played to showcase the stories of Department of Veterans Affairs whistleblowers. Fox personalities Rachel Campos-Duffy and Will Cain said after the appearance that Hegseth would “make one hell of” a secretary of defense.Trump’s award also marks the culmination of Fox’s reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years.Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again.Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends.Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal.On Thursday, he was more magnanimous.“You have incredible people at Fox,” he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.”Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month.This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago.___AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.25 -24 "

  "content": "STORY: Donald Trump has named former PayPal executive David Sacks as AI and crypto czar. In a social media post, the president elect said Sacks would focus on making the U.S. a world leader in both fields. He says his administration will ensure 'the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for'. Trump once labelled such currencies a scam, but embraced the sector during his election campaign. His victory has seen bitcoin surge on bets that the new administration will be friendlier to digital assets. This week the top cryptocurrency broke through the $100,000 level for the first time, though it later dropped back. It is up around 50% since Trump's election win. Sacks was formerly chief operating officer at PayPal. Among other things, he also founded the business social network Yammer. He was an early advocate of cryptocurrencies, saying in a 2017 interview that bitcoin would revolutionise the internet. One analyst told Reuters that Sacks was seen as a strong backer of crypto, with a history of investing in tokens besides just bitcoin. Earlier in the week, Trump named strong crypto advocate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. That added to optimism for the sector, with the U.S. financial watchdog hitherto seen as unfriendly to crypto."

The digital coin's downtrend resulted in 209,431 crypto traders liquidated, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $18.94 million. Total losses after Bitcoin's crash reached $1.10 billion from the night of Dec. 4 through Dec. 5, 2024. CoinGlass Traders on OKX suffered the largest brunt of the overnight bloodbath, with \"rekt\" long positions exceeding $268 million. Binance traders come in next, losing a total of $123.30 million during BTC's plunge.The world's top digital asset is currently trading at around $97,000 and $98,000, still some $5,000 away from its spike earlier in the day. Bitcoin price on the night of Dec. 5, 2024 CoinGecko Bitcoin Makes HistoryThe significant losses came after BTC hit $100,000 for the first time since its launch. The milestone also drove Bitcoin's market capitalization above $2 trillion, making it the first cryptocurrency to join the world's ranked companies with the largest market values.Celebrations filled up social media, led by the crypto community on X. Prominent leaders hosted Spaces and Live videos to discuss the development that placed crypto on a pedestal it never had since being introduced to the world in 2008 through Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper.Crypto Begins Trekking Recovery RoadWhen Bitcoin plunged, many cryptocurrencies followed suit, but while BTC struggles to reclaim $100,000, some top altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance's BNB are making gradual progress toward recovery. Top crypto prices on the night of Dec. 5, 2024 CoinGecko Memecoins are also moving up, with some outperforming Bitcoin and other major alternative coins in the past 24 hours. Among the better players were Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and dogwifhat (WIF). Prices of top memecoins on the night of Dec. 5, 2024 CoinGecko Sentiment Still on a HighDespite BTC's sudden plunge just after a glorious feat, crypto users remain optimistic as they expect the digital currency to recover soon enough and hopefully, hold the $100,000-line in preparation for another surge.Bitcoin's $100,000 hit was a surprise just as much as its sudden crash was. While many analysts already predicted that BTC will only go higher after it surged in the aftermath of the 2024 U.S. elections, the \"when\" was difficult to project, the moon move was a surprise to many.BTC may have shocked the world with its volatile ups and downs in the last day, but its longer-term chart remains in the green. It's still up by nearly 40% in the last 30 days and is still on a 120% gain in the past year."

  "title": "Best Altcoins to Invest in This Month : Qubetics Sells 270 Million $TICS , Bitcoin Hits $100K for First Time Ever , Solana Eyeing $300",
  "content": " If you’re looking for the best altcoins to invest in this month, it’s shaping up to be a wild ride in the crypto world. Bitcoin has finally smashed through the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone, Solana’s on track for a potential rise to $300, and the rising star Qubetics has already sold a jaw-dropping 270 million $TICS tokens in its presale. From record-breaking highs to game-changing projects, this month isn’t just business as usual—it’s a defining moment in crypto history. While Bitcoin continues to bask in the limelight and Solana gains momentum as a DeFi darling, Qubetics is quietly revolutionising the blockchain landscape with its real-world utility and high-tech solutions. Let’s dive into why these three contenders are dominating the list of the best altcoins to invest in this month and how each offers a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. Qubetics ($TICS): A Presale Revolution Qubetics is the new kid on the blockchain, but it’s playing like a seasoned pro. This Layer 1 Web3 network isn’t just another altcoin; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that solves critical problems other blockchains haven’t been able to crack. Whether it’s seamless cross-chain operability, unparalleled security, or developer-friendly tools like QubeQode, Qubetics is checking all the boxes. The presale numbers speak for themselves. With 270 million $TICS already sold and $4.4 million million raised, Qubetics is hurtling through its presale stages like a rocket. Currently priced at $0.0282, $TICS tokens are drawing in investors faster than crypto Twitter can shout “bullish.” So, what’s the potential here? If you were to invest $40,000 today, you’d snag around 1.42 million $TICS tokens. Analysts predict the price will hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s $355,000—an ROI of 787%. But hold on—it gets better. With a post-presale projection of $1, your $40,000 could transform into a cool $1.42 million. And if Qubetics reaches its mainnet launch target of $15, you’d be looking at a jaw-dropping $21.3 million. But what makes Qubetics more than just a numbers game? Its tech stack. The platform’s decentralised VPN safeguards user privacy, its multichain wallet ensures effortless asset management across ecosystems, and its modular development tools are empowering coders to build faster than ever. If you’re not onboard yet, ask yourself this: do you want to be the person telling their friends, “I almost bought $TICS but didn’t”? Exactly. For more information, watch this video. Bitcoin (BTC): The King Finally Hits $100K After years of anticipation, Bitcoin has finally smashed through the six-figure ceiling, crossing $100,000 for the first time ever. This isn’t just another milestone—it’s a statement on the unshakeable dominance of the world’s first cryptocurrency. While institutional adoption has certainly played its part, the political winds following the recent US election have given it an extra push. With expectations mounting for a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape under a Republican administration, investors have rushed to pile into Bitcoin-backed ETFs, fuelling its meteoric rise. But is Bitcoin still one of the best altcoins to invest in this month? Without a doubt. Its reputation as digital gold cements its place in any well-rounded portfolio. Hedge funds, corporations, and retail investors alike view it as a reliable store of value—especially during times of economic uncertainty. With the psychological barrier of $100,000 now shattered, some analysts are already setting their sights on the next big target: $150,000. What continues to make Bitcoin irresistible is its stability amid crypto’s notorious volatility. Sure, altcoins can promise eye-popping gains (hello, Qubetics!), but Bitcoin offers the comfort of a tried-and-true asset. It’s the foundation of modern crypto portfolios, and for good reason—it’s not just history being made; it’s destiny being fulfilled. Solana (SOL): The Comeback Kid Solana has had its ups and downs, but it’s hard to ignore its meteoric rise in recent months. Currently eyeing $300, SOL is proving that it’s more than just Ethereum’s little brother. With lightning-fast transaction speeds and a robust ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and dApps, Solana is positioning itself as a key player in the Web3 space. What’s driving Solana’s resurgence? For starters, its technology is top-notch. Solana’s Proof of History consensus mechanism enables it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it a favourite for developers and users alike. Then there’s the growing adoption of Solana-based DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces, which are attracting a new wave of users and capital. But the real excitement comes from the recent influx of institutional interest. Hedge funds and venture capitalists are pouring money into Solana projects, signalling that the big players are betting on SOL’s long-term potential. With a price target of $300 on the horizon, Solana is proving that it’s one of the best altcoins to invest in this month—and beyond. Why Qubetics Is a Chance You Can’t Miss Right Now While Bitcoin and Solana are undoubtedly strong contenders, Qubetics stands out as the most exciting opportunity of the month. Its combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world utility, and massive ROI potential makes it a must-watch. And let’s be real—how often do you see a presale with this much momentum? Qubetics isn’t just riding a wave; it’s creating one. By addressing the limitations of older blockchains and building a community-driven ecosystem, it’s laying the groundwork for a new era of Web3. Whether you’re an experienced investor or a crypto newbie, $TICS offers a chance to get in on the ground floor of something truly revolutionary. Conclusion: Don’t Wait, Invest This month is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in crypto history. Bitcoin has hit a historic milestone, Solana is on the cusp of a major rally, and Qubetics is rewriting the rulebook on what a presale can achieve. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins to invest in this month, the time to act is now. Whether you’re looking for stability with Bitcoin, innovation with Solana, or sky-high ROI with Qubetics, the opportunities are endless. But remember: in the world of crypto, timing is everything. Don’t let this month’s headlines become next month’s regrets. Head over to the Qubetics presale, secure your $TICS tokens, and join the blockchain revolution. Because in this game, the early bird doesn’t just get the worm—it gets the entire treasure chest.

  "content": " (Reuters) -U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal (NASDAQ:) Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" another step towards overhauling U.S. policy. \"He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.,\" Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether \"czar\" was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump's tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase (NASDAQ:), called the choice of Sacks a \"strong move\" in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, \"congrats to czar @DavidSacks!\" \"Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails,\" Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters. Jang has co-invested with Sacks in both cryptocurrency and AI startups. He predicted that Sacks will prioritize regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed California's unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump - who once labeled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. \"David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,\" Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:) in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the \"PayPal Mafia\" of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla (NASDAQ:) CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. \"It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money,\" he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. "

  "title": "Trump attends Fox Nation event , receives  Patriot of the Year  award",
  "content": " Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. GREENVALE, N.Y. — Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election. Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation’s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform. “I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. “It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID. Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows. “Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” — a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary. Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well. The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect. The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.\" He played “YMCA” — the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies — and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon. Later, he donned an orange safety vest — a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years. Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again. Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends. Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal. On Thursday, he was more magnanimous. “You have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.\" Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month. This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago. ___ AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

  "content": " Haliey Welch’s $HAWK cryptocurrency experienced massive value crash, with allegations of fraud, insider manipulation. Image: Tim & Dee TV on YouTube Haliey Welch, known online as the “Hawk Tuah Girl,” has found herself embroiled in controversy after the launch of her cryptocurrency, $HAWK, on the Solana blockchain. Welch, who gained viral fame this summer with her explicit sex advice, recently entered the crypto world by promoting $HAWK. The coin quickly surged by 900% in value after its launch on Wednesday, but the excitement was short-lived as its price plummeted by 95%, leading to accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. Many investors suspect that insiders manipulated the coin’s value for quick profit, with some individuals reportedly accumulating large portions of the coin to sell at inflated prices. Despite Welch’s attempts to manage the fallout through a live discussion on X (formerly Twitter), the situation only worsened. During the session, crypto experts, including YouTuber Coffeezilla, criticized the launch, with some calling the project a scam. Concerns grew when it was revealed that $HAWK insiders appeared to be profiting from exorbitant transaction fees. One crypto wallet, for example, accumulated 17.5% of the coin’s total supply and sold it for $1.3 million in just 90 minutes. Welch, who has been promoting the coin to her followers, has not provided clear answers about the situation. Investigative reports later revealed that she had been paid $125,000 for marketing the token and would receive 50% of net proceeds. The controversy continues, with many accusing Welch of neglecting due diligence, resulting in significant financial losses for her fans. Meanwhile, a new “revenge coin,” $TUAH, has emerged, mocking Welch’s involvement and seeking to surpass $HAWK’s market cap. The situation remains under scrutiny as legal and reputational questions persist. "

  "title": "Risk - wary markets count down to payrolls",
  "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu Risk sentiment took a hit in Asia on Friday from renewed political rumblings in South Korea, rattling investors' nerves as they awaited a crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report that could alter the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month. Once markets caught word that there could be another martial law declaration in South Korea, heavy selling hammered the Korean won and the Seoul share market. The won sank by as much as 1%, the KOSPI dived 1.8% at one point and the Australian dollar, a barometer of risk appetite, was down 0.5%. South Korean authorities were quick to act. Dealers said the foreign exchange regulator is believed to have sold U.S. dollars to limit the decline in the won. That would not be surprising, since the authorities have pledged unlimited liquidity to stabilise markets and that tactic has so far been working. The country's special warfare commander also came out to say he would refuse any new order for martial law, calming nerves somewhat. While keeping a wary eye on South Korea, the market's main attention is fixed on U.S. payrolls data due for release later on Friday. Forecasts are centred on a rise of 200,000 jobs in November, rebounding from soft numbers in October that reflected the impact of hurricanes and strikes. The unemployment rate likely edged up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Markets are priced for a Goldilocks outcome: neither so strong that it would threaten the prospects of a rate cut, nor so soft that it would stir up concerns about the economy. Futures imply a 70% chance of a rate cut by the Fed on Dec. 18, suggesting the market is vulnerable to a hot jobs report, particularly after recent soft data emboldened the futures to price in an extra quarter point cut for 2025. Dollar bulls were also wary of a sharp pull-back in jobs, which could boost the outlook for rate cuts and wrong-foot a market that is overwhelmingly long the U.S. currency. Even the rally in Bitcoin is showing signs of fatigue after crossing the $100,000 level for the first time ever. It retreated as far as $92,092 before steadying at $97,444 on Friday, up 0.4% for the day and supported by Trump's appointment of former PayPal executive David Sacks to be his White House \"artificial intelligence and crypto czar\". Europe is looking ahead to a lower open with some secondary data due. EUROSTOXX 50 futures are down 0.4% and FTSE futures are 0.1% lower. U.S. stock futures are a fraction easier. In other news, Trump said he had chosen former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by deep mistrust and trade tensions. Key developments that could influence markets on Friday: -- Germany industrial output -- UK Halifax house prices -- Eurozone revised GDP for Q3 -- U.S. non farm payrolls for Nov (By Stella Qiu; Editing by Edmund Klamann)"

Vance as Trump's running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Vance on his podcast in the process.After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft.Sacks, who like Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups.Bitcoin breached $100,000 on Thursday before dipping back below the symbolically important level.The digital asset has now soared more than 50 percent since the election of Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.\"The historic level was broken after Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator.Atkins \"is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform.\"Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,\" she added.- Musk meetings -Musk met with US lawmakers Thursday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration.Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy.Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Musk's star power and intense influence in Trump's inner circle bring political clout.During Trump's election campaign, Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion.This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs -- something that has never garnered strong political backing.Musk's new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire.Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Musk's favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin.

  "title": "Bitcoin & the End of Money",
  "content": "December 5, 2024 | Bitcoin & the End of MoneyQUESTION: Mr. Armstrong, I just had to write in to say thank you for explaining that Bitcoin was just a trading asset, not some new currency that would replace the dollar. I understand that money must be elastic to grow with society in economic booms and population. I just read a quote reported by Bloomberg: “After four years of political purgatory, Bitcoin and the entire digital-asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream.” I know a programmer who said you were correct that the Deep State created blockchain. Has this recent rise been orchestrated to get us to surrender paper money and rejoice so they can track us all?KSANSWER: There is no question that the blockchain code was developed in the intelligence community. We all know that in the programming world. In 1996, the US government released a white paper entitled “How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash.” Released by the National Security Agency Office of Information Security Research and Technology, this document basically explains how a government agency could create something like Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. (SEE BELOW).Has Bitcoin been manipulated more to make people think digital currencies are better than paper? There is a strong probability of that. This is clearly a dream of tyrants. If I give you $100 bill they do not know where I got it from. If I pay you in Bitcoin, they can trace it to everyone who has ever handled it. This is a control system. This is the END OF MONEY! A new documentary film will be coming out soon on this topic.Here is Lagarde on digital currency. She states this object is “control” everything you do. Europe is a Marxist Paradise. Everyone is an economic slave and whatever they earn belongs to the state – not them. The state will decide how much you are allowed to keep. I really do not understand these Bitcoin people if they deliberately try to convince us to surrender all liberty. With digital currency, they can block even a donation to a political opponent like Trump.Even when creating the Euro, the commission took the entire back row of our conference held in London in 1997. I do not understand why it is so hard to understand what a currency is. They were selling the Euro, which would defeat the dollar. That, too, never took place. They were preaching that everyone would pay the same interest rate as in the USA. I warned them that would only take place if they consolidated all the debts as Hamilton did following the American Revolution.Kohl took Germany into the Euro as a dictator because if the German people were allowed to vote, he admitted he would have lost 7 to 3. We do not live in a democracy. That is sheer propaganda. They make the decisions, and when they know the people will not accept that, even like war, they do it anyway. We mean nothing at the end of the day.They sold Bitcoin as it would be free of central banks, a store of wealth, and eliminate inflation, all absolute total BS that was impossible in the real world. I have warned that this has been a fantastic sales job, and pushing the price up creates the image that it is somehow worth more than paper money, so surrender everything and go digital.People have been braindead when it comes to comprehending what money is and love to cling to stupid theories that will only lead to a major depression. They do not even understand that because the Fed was fearful of inflation during the Great Depression, to support the dollar, they failed to expand the money supply, fearing that the dollar would crash. Over 200 cities issued their own money because there was such a shortage of cash that businesses could not function. It was impossible to pay employees, and people had no cash to spend. This was called depression script.Whenever there is a recession or depression, people reduce their spending and hoard their wealth, contracting both spending and investment. This is a fact proven by the hoards of ancient Roman coins during the turmoil of the 3rd century. The money supply peaked in 1929 and contracted into 1933. This is why there was such a shortage of money that it led to over 200 cities issuing their own depression script just so they could function.We find the very same human response during the financial Panic of 33AD. There was such a shortage of money that private tokens appeared, similar to what took place during the American Civil War and the Great Depression of the 1930s.The firm Seuthes and Son, of Alexandria, was a firm facing difficulties because of the loss of three richly laden ships in a Red Sea storm, followed by a fall in the value of ostrich feathers and ivory. Nearly at the same time, there was the house of Malchus and Co. of Tyre with branches at Antioch and Ephesus. They suddenly became bankrupt as a result of a strike among their Phoenician workmen and the embezzlement of a freedman manager. These two failures also affected the Roman banking house, Quintus Maximus and Lucious Vibo, operating in the Roman forum. We saw the same reaction: people hoarding their wealth, and the severe shortage of money led to the appearance of private coinage.You see the shortage of coinage during the American Civil War prompted a host of civil war tokens that circulated also as money. The same took place in Germany after World War I, and during the 1840s with the Sovereign Defaults of several US states that are known as the Hard Times Tokens.Bitcoin can NEVER become the reserve currency for the entire political system. It would be impossible. All social programs would come to an end, and there would be massive deflation and civil unrest. The money supply always contracts during a recession and depression. We blame the central banks and the dollar when that is like blaming the gun for a murder rather than the guy who pulled the trigger.This is all about CONTROL. The computer has warned that between 2020 and 2032, we will witness the rise of authoritarianism. Governments are on the cusp of an international sovereign default. They are pushing for war as a distraction. The Digital ID and Digital Currency are no different from the paranoia of Joseph Stalin and his great purge to eliminate people he feared by revolting against him.Bitcoin is a trading vehicle as people buy into the propaganda. In the end, the truth always prevails.In 1996, the US government released a white paper entitled, “How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash.” Released by the National Security Agency Office of Information Security Research and Technology, this document basically explains how a government agency could create something like Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.I encourage those interested to read the contents of the link above. This document was released during the dawn of the dot.com bubble before the technology existed to create such a currency. The NSA quickly realized that it could weaponize this technology to create a cashless society.As explained in the introduction: “Among the most important uses of this technology is electronic commerce: performing financial transactions via electronic information exchanged over telecommunications lines. A key requirement for electronic commerce is the development of secure and efficient electronic payment systems. The need for security is highlighted by the rise of the Internet, which promises to be a leading medium for future electronic commerce.Electronic payment systems come in many forms including digital checks, debit cards, credit cards, and stored value cards. The usual security features for such systems are privacy (protection from eavesdropping), authenticity (provides user identification and message integrity), and nonrepudiation (prevention of later denying having performed a transaction) .The type of electronic payment system focused on in this paper is electronic cash. As the name implies, electronic cash is an attempt to construct an electronic payment system modelled after our paper cash system. Paper cash has such features as being: portable (easily carried), recognizable (as legal tender) hence readily acceptable, transferable (without involvement of the financial network), untraceable (no record of where money is spent), anonymous (no record of who spent the money) and has the ability to make “change.” The designers of electronic cash focused on preserving the features of untraceability and anonymity. Thus, electronic cash is defined to be an electronic payment system that provides, in addition to the above security features, the properties of user anonymity and payment untraceability..In general, electronic cash schemes achieve these security goals via digital signatures. They can be considered the digital analog to a handwritten signature. Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography. In such a cryptosystem, each user has a secret key and a public key. The secret key is used to create a digital signature and the public key is needed to verify the digital signature. To tell who has signed the information (also called the message), one must be certain one knows who owns a given public key. This is the problem of key management, and its solution requires some kind of authentication infrastructure. In addition, the system must have adequate network and physical security to safeguard the secrecy of the secret keys.”The introduction goes on to discuss the reasons they could present to the public to switch to a cashless society, including money laundering, convenience, and security. “The term electronic commerce refers to any financial transaction involving the electronic transmission of information. The packets of information being transmitted are commonly called electronic tokens,” the paper continues.The NSA states that it would like to use “user identification” and “message integrity” to protect privacy in “nonrepudiation” transactions. “Eavesdropping” concerns appear numerous times throughout the document, which could be prevented by “not just privacy but anonymity” in the form of “payer anonymity” and “payment untraceability.” The government clearly states that hard currency, cash, provided these luxuries but could not be traced by the banks and, therefore, the government.Again, this was released in 1996 before basic online banking. The document outlines basic online banking but takes it a step further by explaining how they could seemingly make payments seem “untraceable” to the public using “blind signatures” that allegedly cannot be seen by the bank. “This step is called “blinding” the coin, and the random quantity is called the blinding factor. The Bank signs this random-looking text, and the user removes the blinding factor.”PROTOCOL 3: Untraceable On-line electronic payment.Withdrawal: Alice creates an electronic coin and blinds it. Alice sends the blinded coin to the Bank with a withdrawal request. Bank digitally signs the blinded coin. Bank sends the signed blinded coin to Alice and debits her account. Alice unblinds the signed coin.Payment/Deposit: Alice gives Bob the coin. Bob contacts Bank and sends coin. Bank verifies the Bank’s digital signature. Bank verifies that coin has not already been spent. Bank enters coin in spent-coin database. Bank credits Bob’s account and informs Bob. Bob gives Alice the merchandise.“This makes remote transactions using electronic cash totally anonymous: no one knows where Alice spends her money and who pays her.” Full “payment anonymity” would be “too much to ask”, thus, “we are forced to settle for payer anonymity.” In other words, the illusion that no one knows who is making the transaction.PROTOCOL 5: Off-line cash.Withdrawal: Alice creates an electronic coin, including identifying information. Alice blinds the coin. Alice sends the blinded coin to the Bank with a withdrawal request. Bank verifies that the identifying information is present. Bank digitally signs the blinded coin. Bank sends the signed blinded coin to Alice and debits her account. Alice unblinds the signed coin.Payment: Alice gives Bob the coin. Bob verifies the Bank’s digital signature. Bob sends Alice a challenge. Alice sends Bob a response (revealing one piece of identifying info). Bob verifies the response. Bob gives Alice the merchandise.Deposit: Bob sends coin, challenge, and response to the Bank. Bank verifies the Bank’s digital signature. Bank verifies that coin has not already been spent. Bank enters coin, challenge, and response in spent-coin database. Bank credits Bob’s account.Note that, in this protocol, Bob must verify the Bank’s signature before giving Alice the merchandise. In this way, Bob can be sure that either he will be paid or he will learn Alice’s identity as a multiple spender.The government begins to explain basic blockchain concepts, or at least how they’d like them to occur. “When Alice spends her coins with Bob, his challenge to her is a string of K random bits. For each bit, Alice sends the appropriate piece of the corresponding pair. For example, if the bit string starts 0110. . ., then Alice sends the first piece of the first pair, the second piece of the second pair, the second piece of the third pair, the first piece of the fourth pair, etc. When Bob deposits the coin at the Bank, he sends on these K pieces.If Alice re-spends her coin, she is challenged a second time. Since each challenge is a random bit string, the new challenge is bound to disagree with the old one in at least one bit. Thus Alice will have to reveal the other piece of the corresponding pair. When the Bank receives the coin a second time, it takes the two pieces and combines them to reveal Alice’s identity…Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The term zero-knowledge proof refers to any protocol in public-key cryptography that proves knowledge of some quantity without revealing it (or making it any easier to find it). In this case, Alice creates a key pair such that the secret key points to her identity. (This is done in such a way the Bank can check via the public key that the secret key in fact reveals her identity, despite the blinding.) In the payment protocol, she gives Bob the public key as part of the electronic coin. She then proves to Bob via a zero-knowledge proof that she possesses the corresponding secret key. If she responds to two distinct challenges, the identifying information can be put together to reveal the secret key and so her identity.”The document then discusses ways to blind the signature, so that the payee may remain anonymous. Now, why would the government allow that to occur? “Even in anonymous, untraceable payment schemes, the identity of the multiple-spender can be revealed when the abuse is detected. Detection after the fact may be enough to discourage multiple spending in most cases, but it will not solve the problem. If someone were able to obtain an account under a false identity, or were willing to disappear after re-spending a large sum of money, they could successfully cheat the system.”The document even discusses what we now would refer to as a crypto wallet. A seemingly safe offline method to store these electronic coins. They explain that at least one party must always reveal their hand. “When a coin is spent, the spender uses his secret to create a valid response to a challenge from the payee. The payee will verify the response before accepting the payment. In Brands’ scheme with wallet observers, this user secret is shared between the user and his observer. The combined secret is a modular sum of the two shares, so one share of the secret reveals no information about the combined secret.”Who is the “observer” in this scenario? “An observer could also be used to trace the user’s transactions at a later time, since it can keep a record of all transactions in which it participates. However, this requires that the Bank (or whoever is doing the tracing) must be able to obtain the observer and analyze it. Also, not all types of observers can be used to trace transactions.”In the event that a transaction was compromised, the bank would have to change its secret key and “INVALIDATE ALL COINS.”The authors explain that tax evasion, per usual, is the key concern. They mention money laundering and “old crimes such as kidnapping and blackmail” as reasons to allow backdoor entry. Restoring traceability was a proposed solution, and if they could restore traceability in the first place, one must question if the payments were ever truly anonymous. Using Alice as their example, they explain that they could simply issue a warrant and track all her payment history. “Back~ard traceability is the ability to identify a withdrawal record (and hence the payer), given a deposit record (and hence the identity of the payee). Backward tracing will reveal who Alice has been receiving payments from.”So, while the bank only sees the deposit in encrypted form, the public key must be used for withdrawal. “The ability to trace transactions in either direction can help law enforcement officials catch tax evaders and money launderers by revealing who has paid or has been paid by the suspected criminal. Electronic blackmailers can be caught because the deposit numbers of the victim’s ill-gotten coins could be decrypted, identifying the blackmailer when the money is deposited.” “In conclusion, the potential risks in electronic commerce are magnified when anonymity is present. Anonymity creates the potential for large sums of counterfeit money to go undetected by preventing the identification of forged coins. Anonymity also provides an avenue for laundering money and evading taxes that is difficult to combat without resorting to escrow mechanisms. Anonymity can be provided at varying levels, but increasing the level of anonymity also increases the potential damages. It is necessary to weigh the need for anonymity with these concerns. It may well be concluded that these problems are best avoided by using a secure electronic payment system that provides privacy, but not anonymity.”The US government released this document in 1996, 27 years ago. Bitcoin was allegedly anonymously created in 2009, and numerous other blockchain-based payment coins have followed. This, paired with the push for CBDC, where the government simply does not need to pretend payments are anonymous, should make one question the security and longevity of cryptocurrencies.Listen to Podcast: Your browser does not support the audio element.

  "title": "What happened Friday",
  "content": "A review of things you need to know before you sign off on Friday; BNZ exits another 5% TD rate, home ownership rises, Revolut wants banking license, more public debt, swaps and NZD stable, bitcoin slips back, & more Here are the key things you need to know before you leave work today (or if you work from home, before you shutdown your laptop). MORTGAGE/LOAN RATE CHANGES SBS Bank, NBS, and UnityMoney all cut their 6 month to 2 year fixed home loan rates. WBS cut its variable and fixed rates too. All rates are here. TERM DEPOSIT/SAVINGS RATE CHANGES BNZ cut many TD rates 1 year and shorter. They no longer have a 5% one year rate, in fact they now only have 5%+ rate for a 6 month term. Rate cuts also came from SBS Bank, WBS and AMP. All updated rates less than 1 year are here, for 1-5 years, they are here. A DATA SURPRISE FOR SOME Census data shows the proportion of people owning their own home is increasing. And renting is declining, according to census data that kind of cuts across the barbeque-conversation narrative that has been widely accepted. \"SUCCESSFUL TRIAL\" Since September, Foodstuffs NI has been conducting a trial using facial recognition (FR) systems to defer retail crime. Today, they released an \"independent assessor's report\". This final evaluation report by independent analytics firm, Scarlatti, which monitored and evaluated the trial, found there was “strong quantitative evidence” that the use of FR reduced serious harmful behaviour in trial stores by an estimated 16%. The Scarlatti report says a total of 1,742 FR alerts of offenders and their accomplices were generated across stores during the trial – an average of 70 a store – of which around 50% resulted in the person being approached. Scarlatti Director, Dr Adam Barker, said the 16% harm reduction was equivalent to around 100 serious harm events averted, including assaults, abuse and other aggressive or disorderly conduct. But the trial had some rough edges and there are a handful of disgruntled people who claim they were targeted and trespassed 'wrongly' as a result. ANNOUNCEMENT DUE Word is that the Government will release its plans on replacing the Cook Strait ferries next Wednesday, December 11, 2024. The strategy around rail capacity will be the key issue (in addition to the costs). That is sure to kick of a pre-Christmas bun-fight. NZX EQUITY MARKET UPDATE Here is a summary of how the NZX equity market traded today, as at 3pm. The NZX50 is flat today, finishing the week with a -1.5% decline. Oceania Healthcare, Mercury Energy, lead the gainers with Kathmandu, SkyTV, falling back. LIVESTOCK DE-STOCKING CONTINUES In the year to June 2024, the number of beef cattle was 3.7 mln, little-changed from 2023 but down -5.8% from 2020. The number of sheep was 23.6 mln, down -3% from 2023 and down -9.4% from 2020. The number of dairy cattle was 5.9 mln, up +1% from 2023 but down -4.5% from 2020. MEAT MARKET UPDATE Here is a summary from Prime Range Meats: \"This week prices in China for mutton have been wavering as importers are starting to see more product becoming available and product sold now will be arriving after Chinese New Year. Strong interest continues for lamb in the UK and North America. The outlook for beef continues to be positive in the US while China prices are a bit more volatile. Australia’s two last remaining beef processing plants delisted from the China export market [during the Morrison-era trade tiff] have now been reapproved.\" THE NEXT BANK PROSPECT Fintech Revolut says it is applying for RBNZ banking registration, which would see it launch interest-bearing savings products, and a wide range of credit (debt) products. NO CHANCE OF PAYING ANYTHING BACK ANZ has been looking at what the Christmas eve HYEFY is likely to reveal, and they have flagged higher borrowing in the current ear by as much as +$2 bln taking them to a peak of $40 bln this year. That is not a signal of strength in the current fiscal policy settings. They also think additional borrowings will be required in the 2026/27 and 2027/28 out years. EYES ON RBI We have noted this before, but it has suddenly got worse. The Indian rupee has fallen -0.8% in the past week, -1.6% over the past six months, extending falls that compounds the long-running decline that started 45 years ago, but has gotten particularly problematic now. Most analysts are not expecting the Reserve Bank of India to cut its 6.5% policy rate when they meet today, probably fearful it will make the international value of their currency fall even further. But other metrics suggest a rate cut is probably warranted. (The rupee is also very low vs the NZD, but to be fair, it is at levels similar to the past ten year average). BACK FROM THE BRINK In Argentina, their central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate by -300 bps to 32% earlier today as part of efforts to curb high inflation. This decision follows a -500 bps rate cut the previous month and marks the eighth reduction since President Javier Milei assumed office in December. The central bank policy rate is down from 126% in October 2023. Inflation in Argentina is down from a peak of 292% in April 2024to 193% in October. Monthly inflation is however now running at an annualised rate of 32%. Many readers will remember Milei's election vow to dollarise the Argentine economy. That hasn't happened and probably won't now. SWAP RATES HOLDWholesale swap rates are probably little-changed yet again today. Most analysts don't see them falling much from here. Our chart below will record the final positions. The 90 day bank bill rate was also little-changed yesterday at 4.33%. The Australian 10 year bond yield is unchanged from this time yesterday, still at 4.28%. The China 10 year bond rate has fallen again, another -2 bps, to a new all-time low of 1.95%. The NZ Government 10 year bond rate is up +4 bps at 4.54% while today's RBNZ fix was 4.48% and up +8 bps. The UST 10yr yield is now at 4.18% and down -1 bp. Their 2yr is now at 4.15%, so that positive curve is still +3 bps, all little-changed ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report. EQUITIES MIXED The NZX50 has fallen -0.4% in late trade today. The ASX200 is down -0.5% in afternoon trade. Tokyo has opened its Friday trade down -0.8%. Hong Kong is up +0.2% and Shanghai up +0.1%. But Singapore is down -0.3% at its open. Wall Street ended its Thursday trade down -0.2% on the S&P500. OIL SLIPS The oil price is down -50 USc from yesterday, now at US$68/bbl in the US, and just under US$72/bbl for the international Brent price. CARBON PRICE DROPS The carbon price is noticeably lower softer today in live trade, now down at US$62.10/NZU and down -$1.25 in a post-government auction reaction. See our new daily chart tracker of the NZU price for carbon, courtesy of emsTradepoint. GOLD DROPS In early Asian trade, gold is down -US$28 from this time yesterday, now at US$2617/oz. NZD SOFTISH The Kiwi dollar is down -10 bps from where were this time yesterday, now at 58.6 USc. Where to from here? Westpac analysts say the USD is likely to rise in Q1-2025 at the expense of many others including the NZD. Against the Aussie we are up +10 bps today at 91.3 AUc. And against the euro we are down -30 bps at 55.5 euro cents. This all means the TWI-5 is now at 68.3 and down -10 bps. BITCOIN EASES BACK The bitcoin price has fallen to US$97,978 and down -2.0% from where we were this time yesterday. Volatility of the past 24 hours has been very high at just over +/- 5.5%.

  "title": "Wall Street edges back from records , bitcoin briefly pops above $100 , 000",
  "content": " NEW YORK – The huge rally for U.S. stocks lost momentum Thursday as Wall Street counted down to a big jobs report that’s coming Friday. The crypto market had more action, and bitcoin briefly burst to a record above $103,000 before pulling back.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from the all-time high it had set the day before, its 56th of the year so far, to shave a bit off what’s set to be one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 248 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before.Bitcoin powered above $100,000 for the first time the night before, after President-elect Donald Trump chose Paul Atkins, who's seen as a crypto advocate, as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk. Sharp swings for bitcoin are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride. After rising as much as 9% in early trading, MicroStrategy, a company that’s been raising cash just to buy bitcoin, swung to a loss of 4.8%. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global fell 3.1% after likewise erasing a big early gain.Elsewhere on Wall Street, stocks of airlines helped lead the way following the latest bumps up to financial forecasts from carriers.American Airlines Group soared 16.8% after saying it’s making more in revenue during the last three months of 2024 than it expected, and it will likely make a bigger profit than it had earlier forecast. The airline also chose Citi to be its exclusive partner for credit cards that give miles in its loyalty program. That should help its cash coming in from co-branded credit card and other partners grow by about 10% annually.Southwest Airlines climbed 2% after saying it’s seeing stronger demand from leisure travelers than it expected. It also raised its forecast for revenue for the holiday traveling season.On the losing end of Wall Street was Synposys, which tumbled 12.4%. The supplier for the semiconductor industry reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it also warned of “continued macro uncertainties” and gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.American Eagle Outfitters fell even more, 14.3%, after the retailer said it’s preparing for “potential choppiness” outside of peak selling periods. It was reminiscent of a warning from Foot Locker earlier in the week and raised more concerns about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain.Solid spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has avoided a recession that earlier seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market. This week’s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels.Expectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.17%, from 4.18% late Wednesday.The S&P 500 fell 11.38 points, to 6,075.11. The Dow sank 248.33 points, to 44,765.71, and the Nasdaq composite lost 34.86 points, to 19,700.26.In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly calm in Europe after far-right and left-wing lawmakers in France joined together to vote on a no-confidence motion that will force Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign. The CAC 40 index in Paris added 0.4%.In South Korea, the Kospi fell 0.9% to compound its 1.4% decline from the day before. President Yoon Suk Yeol was facing possible impeachment after he suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night. He revoked the martial law declaration six hours later.Crude oil prices slipped after eight members of the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries decided to put off increasing oil production.AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

  "content": " AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are near their records Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 92 points higher, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%. Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. “This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have cut rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America. Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface. Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation. “This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said. So, while traders are betting on an 87% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group. For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation. Several retailers offered encouragement for such hopes after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year. Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations. Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target spooked the market after reporting sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 jumped 1.4% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign. In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai aid of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached. Bitcoin was sitting near $99,000 Friday after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. "

A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan’s survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500’s larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500’s climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.

  "title": "Trump names ex - PayPal COO David Sacks as  White House AI & Crypto Czar  ",
  "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his “White House AI & Crypto Czar”, another step towards overhauling US policy. “He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,” Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether “czar” was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump’s incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly-created crypto advisory council. Trump’s tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, called the choice of Sacks a “strong move” in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, “congrats to czar @DavidSacks!” “Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails,” Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters. Jang has co-invested with Sacks in both cryptocurrency and AI startups. He predicted that Sacks will prioritise regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed California’s unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump, who once labeled crypto a scam, embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. “David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,” Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the “PayPal Mafia” of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. “It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money,” he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. Reuters "

  "title": "Ransomware Gang Merciless Attacks Bleed Small Companies Dry",
  "content": " (Bloomberg Markets) — The black-and-white message flickering across computer screens sparked panic at Knights of Old, a 158-year-old UK delivery company: “If you’re reading this, it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead.” Knights’ network for managing trucks was down. So was the system for booking payments. From 2,000 miles away, a criminal, Russia-linked hacking gang known as Akira had sabotaged the computers at Knights of Old and two related trucking companies. To force negotiations, the crooks in June 2023 had deployed malicious software that encrypted Knights’ files and then threatened to publish online its confidential internal data. Paying a ransom would get the company a decryption key that could be used to unlock the compromised computers and servers, Akira said. “For now, let’s keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue,” the gang wrote in a note on Knights’ infected machines. “We’re fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources.” In 2023 ransomware attacks rose 70% from a year earlier, to 4,611, according to the SANS Institute, a cyber­security research and training organization. Since March 2023, Akira alone has victimized more than 350 organizations and extorted an estimated $42 million, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Bloomberg analysis found. (The gang, which maintains a website, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) Akira has had some high-profile targets, such as Nissan Motor Co., Stanford University and Yamaha Motor Co. But ­cybersecurity researchers have found that about 80% of its victims are small and medium-size organizations, most in North America and Europe. “No business can ignore this threat, no matter how big or small,” says Paul Abbott, 58, Knights’ co-owner. According to digital insurance company Embroker, most smaller businesses set their policy limits for cyber­security damages at $1 million, close to the level at Knights. That money could potentially be used to pay a ransom and help rebuild infected computers. But it’s often nowhere near enough. The median ransom payment soared to $6.5 million in 2023, from $335,000 the year before, insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. found. Will Thomas, a cybersecurity expert who’s closely tracked Akira’s attacks, says the group identifies its targets by scanning the internet for servers that are operating outdated software, then opportunistically breaches them. “What they do is not particularly complicated or sophisticated,” Thomas says. “But they are very successful, and they are ruthless.” In 1865, William Knight started making deliveries in a horse and cart he drove through an English village called Old, about 80 miles north of London. Hence his company, now based in nearby Kettering, would come to be known as Knights of Old. Abbott, who grew up in the area, knew the Knight family, and at age 20 he joined Knights of Old. He worked first as a traffic manager, helping to route the trucks and supporting drivers and customers. Abbott steadily climbed the ranks, and around 2007 he and two business partners, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, became directors and then co-­owners. They later joined Knights of Old with two other delivery ­companies—Nelson Distribution Ltd. and Steve Porter Transport Ltd.—under the name KNP Group. By the time of the hack, KNP had almost £100 million ($126 million) in annual revenue, 900 employees, seven depots and 400 trucks. Knights was the biggest and best known of the three companies, its trucks bearing an image of an armored knight and a vivid color scheme of bright blue with huge yellow letters spelling out the motto “Service With Honour.” Among its customers were publishing giants Penguin Random House LLC and Hachette Book Group, which relied on its fleet to distribute millions of books for Amazon.com Inc. and other retailers. In early 2023, KNP leased a 140,000-square-foot warehouse in Luton, near London, as part of an expansion effort. Having experienced computer failures in the past, Abbott and his colleagues had already established an alternative way of working. They could revert to writing out paper tickets and job sheets for each delivery and use their mobile phones and Gmail. Abbott had thought the company was secure. Just a month before the intrusion, he’d arranged a £1 million cyberattack policy through the British insurer Aviva Plc, which declined to comment. Managers had also trained staff on cybersecurity awareness and were paying about £60,000 annually to a contractor that provided support. But following the attack, he says, the contractor—whom he declines to name—provided little help and “didn’t have a clue” what to do. After the initial attack, Aviva arranged for a team of experts from security company Solace Cyber to help. The following morning it began to digitally clean all electronic devices—computers, laptops, even photocopiers—that were connected to the company’s network. Paul Cashmore, Solace’s managing director and co-founder, says the breach had inflicted devastating damage. He recalled navigating Knights’ employees through a roller coaster of emotions. “First there was the shock. Then it’s realization. Then it’s dealing with the impact,” he says. Solace is currently working on about two major ransom­ware incidents every week, Cashmore says, and the pace shows no sign of slowing. Knights consulted US-based company Coveware Inc., which specializes in negotiating with ransomware hackers, Abbott says. The company, which declined to comment, told him that, based on KNP’s size and revenue, the Akira gang would likely expect a payment in Bitcoin worth $2.7 million to $5.3 million. Law enforcement agencies generally advise against paying ransoms because it incentivizes further attacks. Sending cryptocurrency to the gangs could also violate sanctions that are in place against some of the criminals involved. Abbott said he and his partners decided not to negotiate with Akira or pay the gang anything, because there could be no guarantee the data could be fully recovered even with the decryption key. In response the hackers followed through on their threat, publishing more than 10,000 internal documents online—mostly employee payroll files, invoices and other financial information. The company tried to rebuild its computers. Within a few days, Knights’ technicians had set up a new transport management system and recovered an old backup of the warehouse software. But the financial management databases couldn’t be immediately recovered, because hackers had destroyed another backup that was supposed to be stored securely elsewhere. Facing cash-flow pressures, KNP sought a loan. Abbott says the bank would provide it only if the company could supply the missing financial records and performance reports. Still waiting on a payout from the insurance company, the ­co-owners tried to sell the company. A European businessman came close to buying. But, because of the missing financial records, the buyer insisted that the three partners personally guarantee the state of the company’s finances. They’d be putting their houses and savings on the line. The partners balked, according to Abbott. “My wife would never have let me do that, regardless of how confident we were in the business,” he says. On Sept. 25, 2023, KNP Group entered administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy. In Kettering, Abbott announced the news to his employees, some of whom he’d worked with for decades. Another company bought one of KNP’s subsidiaries, Nelson Distribution, saving about 170 jobs. But the rest of KNP’s 700 or so employees, the majority of them from Knights of Old, lost their livelihood. Jeff Maslin, who drove trucks for Knights, says drivers are still owed weeks’ worth of wages. “I know people who lost their house, lost their car and ended up divorced,” he says. KNP later determined that Akira had gained access to the company’s systems using a technique called “brute forcing,” which can employ software that makes thousands or millions of guesses to discover a staffer’s password. Abbott says more sophisticated security monitoring software might have helped detect the intrusion. “If you haven’t got that, get it,” he advises other companies. Earlier this year, administrators began the process of selling Knights’ headquarters, along with KNP’s other assets. The fleet of trucks, mostly leased, has been returned. The insurer eventually paid out on the £1 million policy, but it didn’t cover Knights’ losses in administration. Abbott, now working as a consultant for other logistics companies, recently bought a single truck and plans to use it to start over. “I’ve had to rebuild my life,” he says. “I’ve lost everything.” Gallagher works in Bloomberg’s Edinburgh bureau and covers cybersecurity.

  "content": " There’s a boom coming. Bitcoin has arrived, and its price is setting records. Artificial Intelligence is hot. And the American people just elected a president with a deregulatory mindset.All the ingredients are there. If everything is handled right, America will soon embark on a period of extended wealth creation rarely seen in modern history. For that to occur, a few things must happen, starting with the government staying largely out of the way.That’s hard to do since people rely on government to keep the currency and other mediums of exchange stable. It’s also supposed to root out and protect against fraudsters who take advantage of the hype surrounding any innovative technology to prey on unsuspecting, naïve investors looking to, as the saying goes, “get rich quick.”None of that has to be tossed overboard in pursuit of the newest “new economy.” As we move forward with the integration of crypto technology into the global financial system and overlay AI onto the manufacturing sector, Caveat Emptor – Let the buyer beware – is still a sound strategy for everyone. The better the industry educates the American public about what digital tokens are, how to tell the good from the bad, and how they can be used to transform commerce, the more quickly it will be adopted widely. The same goes for AI, which, up to now, is still talked about as though it were part of a science-fiction future where computers dominate humankind.What people don’t know or are choosing to ignore is that AI is already being used – to significant effect – in healthcare, energy, and manufacturing, leading to lower costs, increased efficiency, and driving breakthroughs that benefit us all.The Mayo Clinic says that AI is already improving the quality of preventive screenings, diagnoses, and treatments, particularly for cancer patients who are experiencing improved outcomes. Bitcoin is also making healthcare better, at least IBM thinks it does. The company has used blockchain, the technology that makes cryptocurrency viable as a transferable store of value, to make health data systems for the Centers for Disease Control better and safer.Accenture and Shell have partnered to use crypto technology to develop an airline booking system for American Express where business travelers can choose to reduce their carbon footprint by quickly matching them with flights that use cleaner fuel.There are groups out there, like the National Cryptocurrency Association, that are working to share information and best practices and educate consumers about the benefits of broader adoption of blockchain. They’re also working to combat misinformation and address the general lack of understanding at the end-user level regarding crypto.Blockchain seems to have a leg up on AI in this regard, but that’s perhaps because it’s been around longer. Nevertheless, the rules of the road are still being written. Gary Gensler, the crypto skeptic who served as chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden, announced recently he’d be stepping down at the end of the current administration. Trump can now replace him with someone friendly to crypto who can promulgate a set of rules that will allow America to close the gap its regulatory inaction has created with nations like China, which are much farther down the road on digital finance.There is growing recognition that a similar effort needs to be made with AI so that the public better understands how it works. The American Association of Retired Persons is one group that recently launched a major initiative, but more needs to be done. Groups like it and the NCA can and should take the lead in educating the public about these technologies, how they work, and why they are worth paying attention to.Modern technologies are for everyone, not a select few. Increasing awareness and education will help us better leverage these technologies from both a practical and policy perspective and will open the door for safe and beneficial mass adoption. We need to bring the public along instead of frightening them.Copyright 2024 Peter Roff distributed by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.

  "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP) – US President-elect Donald Trump late Thursday named former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House “AI and Crypto Czar.” The wealthy tech entrepreneur will take on a newly created role advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. “David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,” Trump said in a social media post. “He will safeguard Free Speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Sacks will also lead a presidential council of advisors on science and technology, according to Trump. (FILES) David Sacks, CEO of Yammer, speaks during the first day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 15, 2024. PHOTO: AFP The entrepreneur, whose wealth has been estimated in the billions of dollars, is considered part of a so-called “PayPal Mafia” cadre of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The group was part of that company’s founding era and members have thrown their clout behind conservative political policies and candidates. Sacks backed J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Vance on his podcast in the process. After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft. Sacks, who like Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups. Bitcoin breached USD100,000 on Thursday before dipping back below the symbolically important level. The digital asset has now soared more than 50 per cent since the election of Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the “bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.” The historic level was broken after Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator. Atkins “is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform. “Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,” she added. Musk meetings Musk met with US lawmakers Thursday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration. Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy. Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Musk’s star power and intense influence in Trump’s inner circle bring political clout. During Trump’s election campaign, Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion. This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs — something that has never garnered strong political backing. Musk’s new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire. Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin. "

  "content": " Trading on Wall Street remained at a standstill for the first four hours of the session (the S&P500 was unchanged, the Dow Jones lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite gained +0.1%), before a timid sell-off materialized from 7:30 pm onwards.Optimists will recall that the S&P500 and Nasdaq set new intraday all-time highs at 6,094.6 (at 7.50pm) and 19,790 (around 6.20pm) respectively.

  "content": " US added a strong 227,000 jobs in November in bounce-back from October slowdownWASHINGTON (AP) — America’s job market rebounded in November, adding 227,000 workers in a solid recovery from the previous month, when the effects of strikes and hurricanes had sharply diminished employers’ payrolls. Last month’s hiring growth was up considerably from a meager gain of 36,000 jobs in October. The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in September and October by a combined 56,000. Friday’s report also showed that the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% in October to a still-low 4.2%. The November data provided the latest evidence that the U.S. job market remains durable even though it has lost significant momentum from the 2021-2023 hiring boom, when the economy was rebounding from the pandemic recession.Federal appeals court upholds law requiring sale or ban of TikTok in the U.S. A federal appeals court panel on Friday upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the law - which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January — is constitutional, rebuffing TikTok’s challenge that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and unfairly targeted the platform. TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.Stock market today: Wall Street rises after solid jobs data boosts chances for a coming rate cutNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation. The S&P 500 added 0.3% Friday and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31 points, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%. Treasury yields also fell, and expectations rose among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks after the jobs report showed stronger hiring than expected but also an uptick in the unemployment rate.Killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO spotlights complex challenge companies face in protecting top brassNEW YORK (AP) — In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million to surround CEO Mark Zuckerberg with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while walking alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take to protect their leaders against threats. And experts say the task of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them is getting more difficult. One of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It’s up to corporate security analysts to decide what represents a real threat.Words on ammo in CEO shooting echo common phrase on insurer tactics: Delay, deny, defendA message left at the scene of an insurance executive’s fatal shooting echoes a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims. The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were written on the ammunition used to kill UnitedHealthcare's CEO. That's according to two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday. The words are similar to the phrase “delay, deny, defend.” That's how attorneys describe insurers denying services and payment, and the title of a 2010 book critical of the industry. Police haven’t officially commented on the words. But Thompson’s shooting and the messages on the ammunition have sparked outrage on social media and elsewhere, reflecting frustration Americans have over the cost and complexity of getting care. Michigan Democrats move to protect reproductive health data before GOP takes control of HouseLANSING, Mich. (AP) — Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year. A bill to protect digital reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps is a Democratic priority as lawmakers meet this month. Democratic women and supporters of the legislation say they are acting with new urgency before President-elect Donald Trump takes office because they don't believe his campaign promise to leave abortion to the states. The rush is also a reaction to Republicans taking control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.Japan's Nippon Steel sets sights on a growing overseas market in its bid to acquire US SteelKASHIMA, Japan (AP) — The signs at Nippon Steel read: “The world through steel,” underlining why Japan’s top steelmaker is pursuing its $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel. Japan's domestic market isn't growing, so Nippon Steel has its eyes on India, Southeast Asia and the United States, where populations are still growing. Nippon Steel gave reporters a tour of one of its plants in Japan on Friday. The bid for U.S. Steet is opposed by President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and American steelworkers. If the deal goes through, U.S. Steel will keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but become subsidiary of Nippon Steel.China's ban on key high-tech materials could have broad impact on industries, economyBANGKOK (AP) — China has banned exports of key materials used for a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce computer chips. Both sides say the controls are justified by national security concerns. Analysts say they could have a much wider impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains, depending on the ability of each side to compensate for loss of access to strategically important materials, equipment and components. Here's why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies.The EU makes an urgent TikTok inquiry on Russia's role in Romanian election turmoilLONDON (AP) — The European Union has sent TikTok an urgent request for more information about Romanian intelligence files suggesting that Moscow coordinated influencers on its platform to promote an election candidate who became the surprise front-runner in the nation’s presidential election. The vote resulted in far-right populist Calin Georgescu coming from out of nowhere to take top spot in the first round of voting. But the election was thrown into turmoil after the country’s top court annulled results from the first round of voting. European Commission officials said Friday that they asked the video sharing platform to comment on the files and to provide information on actions that it’s taking in response.A Chinese vessel has been hijacked off the Somali coast, officials sayMOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Local authorities in Somalia have confirmed that a Chinese-owned fishing vessel with 18 crew members aboard was hijacked last week off the northeastern coast of Xaafuun district in Somalia’s Bari region. An official in the area where the vessel is being held told journalists that the hijackers include the ship’s security guards, who later joined forces with armed men from the coastal region. The European Union’s anti-piracy naval force, Eunavfor Atalanta, brought global attention to the incident after issuing a statement that confirmed the local maritime authorities had notified it and investigations revealed that armed men were in control.

  "content": "Key Highlights USD/JPY is consolidating losses above the 148.65 support zone. A key bearish trend line is forming with resistance at 151.40 on the 4-hour chart. EUR/USD could recover if it clears the 1.0620 resistance zone. Bitcoin breached the milestone level of $100,000 and traded to a new all-time high. USD/JPY Technical Analysis The US Dollar formed a base and recently started a recovery wave from 148.65 against the Japanese Yen. However, USD/JPY faces many hurdles as it approaches the US NFP report. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the 155.88 swing high to the 148.64 low. The pair recovered above the 150.00 resistance level, but it faces many hurdles and remains well below the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hour). On the upside, the pair could face resistance near the 151.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at 151.40. The first major resistance is near the 152.20 level. A close above the 152.50 level could set the tone for another increase. The next major resistance could be the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hour) at 153.10, above which the price could climb higher toward the 154.00 resistance. On the downside, immediate support sits near the 149.50 level. The next key support sits near the 148.65 level. Any more losses could send the pair toward the 146.50 level.

  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%. Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. “This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America. Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface. Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation. “This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said. So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group. For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation. Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year. Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations. Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign. In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached. Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. 12/06/2024 10:18 -0500 © Copyright The Associated Press.

  "title": "Trump appoints  czar  of AI and crypto policy | Borneo Bulletin Online",
  "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP) – US President-elect Donald Trump late Thursday named former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House “AI and Crypto Czar.” The wealthy tech entrepreneur will take on a newly created role advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. “David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,” Trump said in a social media post. “He will safeguard Free Speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Sacks will also lead a presidential council of advisors on science and technology, according to Trump. (FILES) David Sacks, CEO of Yammer, speaks during the first day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 15, 2024. PHOTO: AFP The entrepreneur, whose wealth has been estimated in the billions of dollars, is considered part of a so-called “PayPal Mafia” cadre of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The group was part of that company’s founding era and members have thrown their clout behind conservative political policies and candidates. Sacks backed J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate in the recent US presidential election, hosting Vance on his podcast in the process. After PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Sacks went on to help create other tech firms including Yammer, which was bought by Microsoft. Sacks, who like Musk was born in South Africa, also took to investing in startups. Bitcoin breached USD100,000 on Thursday before dipping back below the symbolically important level. The digital asset has now soared more than 50 per cent since the election of Trump, who has vowed to make the United States the “bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.” The historic level was broken after Trump picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to take over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the markets regulator. Atkins “is unlikely to be as anti-crypto as his predecessor Gary Gensler,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the XTB trading platform. “Politics is driving bitcoin. We doubt that the rally will stop here,” she added. Musk meetings Musk met with US lawmakers Thursday to discuss his plans for overseeing radical government spending cuts under the incoming administration. Trump rewarded the Tesla, X and SpaceX chief for his support during the White House campaign by naming him head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, along with another wealthy ally, Vivek Ramaswamy. Although the office, dubbed DOGE, has a purely advisory role, Musk’s star power and intense influence in Trump’s inner circle bring political clout. During Trump’s election campaign, Musk vowed to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion. This would represent cutting total US spending by a third, almost certainly meaning devastation of social support programs — something that has never garnered strong political backing. Musk’s new role raises the question of potential conflicts of interest, since he could be issuing policy recommendations that impact directly on his own business empire. Underlining the close connection to DOGE, Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency is called Dogecoin. "

  "title": "Trump names ex - PayPal COO David Sacks as  White House AI & Crypto Czar  ",
  "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his “White House AI & Crypto Czar”, another step towards overhauling US policy. “He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,” Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether “czar” was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump’s incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly-created crypto advisory council. Trump’s tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, called the choice of Sacks a “strong move” in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, “congrats to czar @DavidSacks!” “Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails,” Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters. Jang has co-invested with Sacks in both cryptocurrency and AI startups. He predicted that Sacks will prioritise regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed California’s unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump, who once labeled crypto a scam, embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. “David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,” Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the “PayPal Mafia” of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. “It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money,” he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. Reuters "

  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%. Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. “This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year.

  "content": "This is member-exclusive contentOpinionA new rule will require crypto mining companies to register with the state and report their energy consumption, as mandated by a new Texas law. (Jan Lievens/Dreamstime/TNS)(Jan Lievens/Dreamstime / TNS)Crypto mining facilities must now register with the state and report their projected energy consumption for the next five years.This is a positive step to ensure reliability in a state where crypto miners and data centers require vast amounts of power as they continue to set up shop in Texas.This new rule, mandated by a 2023 bill authored by state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas, is helpful, but the Legislature and state officials must remain vigilant to protect the grid from surging demands on power.“This law will help ERCOT to have an insight into how much large, flexible load is out there,” Johnson told us. “It also allows for greater information flow between ERCOT and crypto.”Texas officials are walking a tightrope. The light regulatory environment of the Lone Star State entices crypto miners to establish their operations here in the first place. Still, there is a delicate balance between energy production and consumption, and we need ground rules.Crypto mining facilities that consume more than 75 megawatts of power are now required to register with the Public Utility Commission by Feb. 1 and report their projected energy consumption to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. This way, the state can keep track of their energy demand and work closely with them. Cryptocurrency miners can reduce their power consumption quickly when demand on the grid is high.The next level, explains Johnson, would be to allow crypto miners to operate a controllable load resource. This is a deal between the power consumer and ERCOT allowing power to be cut when the price reaches a certain point.“We know we have large consumers. We can call them and tell them to stop buying power,” Johnson said.There are still some legal obstacles to overcome before moving forward with this plan.Crypto miners use specialized high-energy computers to validate transactions and to create cryptocurrency. In Texas, they can consume up to 2,300 megawatts a day. A single megawatt can power some 1,000 homes.Energy demand in Texas is expected to nearly double in six years and much of this demand will come from large power consumers. Legislators are pondering the question of how much oversight is needed.In June, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick warned about the need to set up guardrails for large energy consumers.Right now, ERCOT can pay large power users who promise to reduce their consumption when needed. Crypto firms can also buy power ahead of time and sell it back to the state. Bitcoin miners have profited from these arrangements causing some controversy, but that is the nature of the current market.But we don’t see this as a long-term solution. Over time, crypto power users need to demonstrate they can produce their own power, saving the market from the rush of their demands and compromising the grid.We welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor.

  "content": "Key Highlights USD/JPY is consolidating losses above the 148.65 support zone. A key bearish trend line is forming with resistance at 151.40 on the 4-hour chart. EUR/USD could recover if it clears the 1.0620 resistance zone. Bitcoin breached the milestone level of $100,000 and traded to a new all-time high. USD/JPY Technical Analysis The US Dollar formed a base and recently started a recovery wave from 148.65 against the Japanese Yen. However, USD/JPY faces many hurdles as it approaches the US NFP report. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the 155.88 swing high to the 148.64 low. The pair recovered above the 150.00 resistance level, but it faces many hurdles and remains well below the 100 simple moving average (red, 4-hour). On the upside, the pair could face resistance near the 151.50 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at 151.40. The first major resistance is near the 152.20 level. A close above the 152.50 level could set the tone for another increase. The next major resistance could be the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hour) at 153.10, above which the price could climb higher toward the 154.00 resistance. On the downside, immediate support sits near the 149.50 level. The next key support sits near the 148.65 level. Any more losses could send the pair toward the 146.50 level. Looking at Bitcoin, the bulls pumped the price above the $100,000 resistance zone and the price traded to a new record high above $104,000 on TitanFX.

  "title": "  Youre welcome : Trump after Bitcoin hits $100 , 000 mark",
  "content": "Bitcoin made history on Thursday, breaking the $100,000 mark for the first time, after US president-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins to lead the securities and exchange commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency, which has soared more than 50% since Trump’s election victory, reached an all-time high of $103,800.45 during Asian trading hours before stabilising around $101,000.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump celebrated the rally, writing: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” The former president has recently become a vocal proponent of digital currencies, a significant shift from his earlier stance branding them a \"scam.\"Atkins, a known cryptocurrency advocate, who has been co-chairman of the digital chamber of commerce since 2017, is seen as a supporter of deregulation in the sector.“Paul is a proven leader for common-sense regulations,” Trump said in a statement, adding that Atkins’ appointment aligns with his vision to make the US the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.\"Trump added, \"He also recognises that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.”Atkins’ nomination is expected to signal a regulatory shift favouring innovation, boosting investor confidence in digital assets. Atkins replaced Gary Gensler, who oversaw increased regulation of the sector. This year, however, the SEC did authorised two new cryptocurrency-related financial products for trading.Matt Britzman, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, mentioned, \"Institutional interest and regulatory shifts are adding legitimacy, turning what once seemed like a fringe asset into a force reshaping finance.” He added, \"Love it or doubt it, bitcoin's climb is rewriting the rule book for digital assets.”Trump, who previously called cryptocurrencies a \"scam,\" launched his own digital currency platform, World Liberty Financial, in September. He has also aligned himself with Elon Musk, a cryptocurrency supporter. Musk reacted to Bitcoin’s milestone on X, writing, \"Wow\". The incoming administration is anticipated to create a US bitcoin reserve using seized tokens."

  "title": "Up 300 % In A Month , XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up",
  "content": "Updated Dec 6, 2024, 08:31am EST XRP logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a Bitcoin Logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images The price of Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, has surged over 300% in a month and it is up nearly 1,000% from levels of $0.22 in early 2021 to $2.37 now. In fact, XRP has become the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of around $135 billion - after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether - thanks to its recent rally. Notably, XRP’s gains dwarf the incredible 200% returns that AI posterchild NVDA’s stock has garnered so far this year (Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?) The surge in XRP mirrors the trend seen across cryptocurrencies after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential elections, as hopes that the new administration will take a friendly approach toward digital currencies sparked unprecedented interest in them. After all, in one of his rallies, Trump said he would make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world. This has led to the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time ever - more than doubling from the level of $44,000 at the beginning of the year. Ripple is a digital payment network that uses its cryptocurrency, XRP, to facilitate fast and low-cost international money transfers. For Ripple, it’s not just the Trump factor driving the move in XRP. Back in 2020, the U.S. SEC alleged that Ripple raised more than $1.3 billion in 2013 by selling XRP in an unregistered security offering to investors. Ripple stated that XRP should not be treated as a security. In 2023, the court ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to the public on an exchange and that it did not violate federal securities laws. However, the court also ruled that XRP is a security if sold to institutional investors. This mixed ruling led the SEC to seek a $2 billion fine against Ripple. But this didn’t go the SEC’s way, and the court imposed a $125 million penalty instead. A couple of months back, a judge denied the SEC’s motion to appeal the ruling. Earlier this month, a group of state attorneys general and the DeFi Education Fund sued the SEC, alleging unconstitutional overreach. In this particular instance, the regulator is accused of exceeding its regulatory obligations by initiating enforcement actions against digital asset exchanges. [1] The result? The current chair of the SEC – Gary Gensler – will step down on January 20, 2025, and it’s likely the new person stepping in will be more crypto-friendly. One of the possible candidates includes Paul Atkins, who will be seen favorably by the crypto advocates. There’s a chance that the SEC may drop the entire case against Ripple, which will be another positive for XRP. Overall, XRP has had a great couple of months, and with the Trump administration, this breakout could well be just the beginning of a much larger rally. A key driver of growth for XRP is likely to be Ripple’s impending launch of the RLUSD stablecoin. The RLUSD is currently awaiting approval, and as a stablecoin, it will be fully backed by cash in the form of USD, government treasury securities, and other cash equivalents. Although XRP has seen a stellar 1000% rise since early 2021, the returns haven’t been consistent. Returns for XRP were 278% in 2021, -59% in 2022, and 81% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 — indicating that XRP underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the broader markets — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks and even cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington’s ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it’s Washington’s very embrace of bitcoin that’s helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers. Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who’s seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto. It’s the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States “the crypto capital of the planet.” The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen. It’s a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year’s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization. Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin’s early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn’t be beholden to any government or financial institution. In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet “works well enough for most transactions.” But, Nakamoto said, it “still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,” where a third party like a bank needs to process payments. Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” That is what became the bitcoin network. Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of “digital gold,” or a way to store value in something that’s not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank. In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it’s also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts. Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as “crypto winters” that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX. With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who’s about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. “$100,000!!!

  "title": "Man steps up legal action as Bitcoin dumped at tip now worth £635million",
  "content": "A man who 'threw away' a Bitcoin fortune has stepped up his fight to retrieve it - after its value soared to a record high £635million. James Howells, 39, has launched court action against a council that has refused to let him excavate computer equipment needed to unlock his 8,000 Bitcoins. The costly error a decade ago saw his then partner throw away a black bin bag containing the drive he needed to gain access to his stash. It has since laid in a rubbish tip run by Newport Council in Wales and he has spent years fighting for the right to retrieve it. And as the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time record high soaring above $102k per unit for the first time - his lost collection is now valued at more than £635million. James appeared in court for the first time this week for the start of legal proceedings he has launched against the council - a move he described as a 'last resort.' During the hearing on Monday, a judge at Cardiff High Court heard submissions on a 'strike out' application made by the council. James' legal team claimed he had a team of experts who could go in and retrieve it with no cost to the public purse - while the council argued it would have a 'negative environmental impact'. Following the hearing in Cardiff, Judge Keyser KC said he would reserve his decision until a later date. If the council application to 'strike out' is not granted it would pave the way for a full two week hearing within the next six months. James has also pledged to donate ten per cent of proceeds back to the local area - an offer that the council's legal term accused of being a \"bribe\" to the council. But speaking before the case, James said the council has continually refused to engage - and had missed the opportunity to turn Newport into the 'Dubai or Las Vegas' of the UK. He said: \"Despite being thrown out by my ex partner, which was a mistake and was without my permission or consent, I still own the intellectual digital property located on the hard drive. I am either entitled to recover the property at full cost to myself or if the landowner refuses they it they pay me the value of my property. \"I would much rather say let's have a conversation and let’s dig and work together amicably - but they don't want to know. I instigated the court action that should take about three to six months. Should I be successful in defeating the 'throw out' application' I will be proceeding within three to six months with a full two week court case. \"It is crazy money that could do so much good for the area.\" James said he didn't want to go down the court route - but claimed a lack of engagement from the council left him no choice. If his team are eventually allowed in he said the final haul would be split between expert recovery teams, businesses and investors. And he also pledged to gift ten per cent to the local community to improve the area. He added: \"The council lives in the dark ages. Newport could have looked like Las Vegas or Dubai if they had the foresight to engage. But they did not understand crypto currency and have refused to learn. \"If they had spoken to me back then about investment in crypto the whole area - the whole of South Wales - could have profited from the rise. But they were not intelligent enough or willing to listen to do so. I have continued to try and engage with them and they've rejected all communication with us.\" James said he has assembled a strong legal team and experts to fight the case. He added: \"In June this year I finally decided to take legal action against Newport Council - this is a last resort. They have continued to ignore my reasonable requests so legal action is the only course I could take. \"The assets are legally owned on their property. I am the owner of those and I have that legal right to retrieve my property. I believe I can do so at no cost or impact to Newport Council - yet they continue to refuse any efforts to engage. I've employed a team that have done multiple landfill excavations - all within environmental guidelines. \"We also have AI experts that have the tech to make the job of finding the needle in the haystack that much easier. I can carry out everything at no cost to the public.\" James said although the claim is for around £500M he said all Bitcoin needs to do is hit £125k and it would break through the billion pound barrier. Newport City Council said: \"Newport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to be in our landfill site. \"The council has told Mr. Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area. The council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site. \"Mr. Howells's claim has no merit, and the council is vigorously resisting it.\"Story SavedYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right."

  "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis : FOMO Traders Beware , BTC  High - Wave  Price Action Points to Confusion",
  "content": "BTC's latest price action signals considerable confusion in the market in a shift away from the recent dominance of the bulls. Dec 6, 2024, 7:02 a.m. UTCTraders looking to impulsively take exposure to bitcoin (BTC) at record prices due to the \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO) should note that the market now looks notably confused, a shift away from the recent strong bull momentum.The confusion is evident in BTC's trading on Thursday, as it finally rose to six figures, tapping record highs near $103,900 before plummeting to $91,100, ultimately ending the day in UTC at approximately $97,000, data from TradingView and CoinDesk show. The trading range was so large that it engulfed all the price action since Nov. 20.This led to the formation of a \"high wave candle,\" characterized by a small real body that shows the gap between the open and closing prices, along with large shadows (wicks) that reflect unusually wide price swings throughout the day.It's a sign that the bulls now have less than full control, with sellers looking to reassert themselves, serving as a cautionary indicator for those looking to chase the market at this moment. This cautionary signal becomes even more significant given that the pattern has appeared at record highs, representing a failure to maintain gains above the closely-watched $100,000 mark.\"The long upper shadows mean that sometime after the session's open, buying pressure thrust the security's price to an extended high. During the same session, selling pressure drove the price to a protracted low. Yet, by the session's close, the price returned almost to the opening price. That's confusion,\" CMT's explainer for high-wave candles says.The high wave candle gets its name because Japanese traders liken the extended shadows, or wicks, to large ocean waves.BTC's daily candlesticks chart with 14-day RSI. (TradingView/CoinDesk) The high wave candle, coupled with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, a momentum indicator, points to consolidation or a temporary bearish shift in the market trend. A bearish divergence occurs when the momentum oscillator sich as the RSI doesn't confirm the new high in prices. The message is consistent with several analysts expressing concerns about overcrowding in long positions and the potential for price pullbacks.Moreover, directional plays become challenging while prices remain locked within Thursday's range, indicating ongoing market confusion. If it breaks below the range, more sellers may enter the market. Conversely, a move above Thursday's high would suggest a resumption of the bullish trend.Notably, Deribit-listed BTC calls expiring at the end of December now trade at a three volatility premium over puts, down from the five or higher seen on Thursday, according to data source Amberdata. This shift indicates that bullish sentiment has tempered.Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.Omkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

  "title": "Texas now has an insight into crypto energy load",
  "content": "This is member-exclusive contentOpinionA new rule will require crypto mining companies to register with the state and report their energy consumption, as mandated by a new Texas law. (Jan Lievens/Dreamstime/TNS)(Jan Lievens/Dreamstime / TNS)Crypto mining facilities must now register with the state and report their projected energy consumption for the next five years.This is a positive step to ensure reliability in a state where crypto miners and data centers require vast amounts of power as they continue to set up shop in Texas.This new rule, mandated by a 2023 bill authored by state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas, is helpful, but the Legislature and state officials must remain vigilant to protect the grid from surging demands on power.“This law will help ERCOT to have an insight into how much large, flexible load is out there,” Johnson told us. “It also allows for greater information flow between ERCOT and crypto.”Texas officials are walking a tightrope. The light regulatory environment of the Lone Star State entices crypto miners to establish their operations here in the first place. Still, there is a delicate balance between energy production and consumption, and we need ground rules.Crypto mining facilities that consume more than 75 megawatts of power are now required to register with the Public Utility Commission by Feb. 1 and report their projected energy consumption to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. This way, the state can keep track of their energy demand and work closely with them. Cryptocurrency miners can reduce their power consumption quickly when demand on the grid is high.The next level, explains Johnson, would be to allow crypto miners to operate a controllable load resource. This is a deal between the power consumer and ERCOT allowing power to be cut when the price reaches a certain point.“We know we have large consumers. We can call them and tell them to stop buying power,” Johnson said.There are still some legal obstacles to overcome before moving forward with this plan.Crypto miners use specialized high-energy computers to validate transactions and to create cryptocurrency. In Texas, they can consume up to 2,300 megawatts a day. A single megawatt can power some 1,000 homes.Energy demand in Texas is expected to nearly double in six years and much of this demand will come from large power consumers. Legislators are pondering the question of how much oversight is needed.In June, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick warned about the need to set up guardrails for large energy consumers.Right now, ERCOT can pay large power users who promise to reduce their consumption when needed. Crypto firms can also buy power ahead of time and sell it back to the state. Bitcoin miners have profited from these arrangements causing some controversy, but that is the nature of the current market.But we don’t see this as a long-term solution. Over time, crypto power users need to demonstrate they can produce their own power, saving the market from the rush of their demands and compromising the grid.We welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor.

  "title": "Bitcoin Volatility Spikes Above $100K - What Will It Take for Another Move Higher ? ",
  "content": "Bitcoin reached $100,000 but declined amid profit-taking and volatility. Trump's actions remain the main driver but keep an eye on other factors. Key resistances at $99,000 and $105,000 should hold key to future movements. Discover the top stocks poised to benefit amid stock market's surge using InvestingPro's powerful tools - now up to 55% off amid the Extended Cyber Monday offer! After reaching the eagerly awaited $100,000 milestone this week, declined due to profit-taking and a risk-averse outlook ahead of today's anticipated report. Beyond the technical factors driving the cryptocurrency higher, Trump's decision to appoint Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, to lead the SEC supports a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin. In contrast, Jerome Powell's statement that Bitcoin should not compete with the US dollar is expected to have a more limited impact.Bitcoin's Rapid Price Movements Raise ConcernsWhile these developments drove Bitcoin to a new record high yesterday, sellers took control of the market later in the day. The pullback that began during the US session transitioned into a recovery as Asian trading commenced, reminiscent of earlier days in the cryptocurrency market. This 10% decline quickly wiped out accumulated long positions, with data showing around $300 million in long positions and $400 million in futures liquidated within minutes. The latest outlook suggests Bitcoin will face challenges around the $100,000 mark. A significant portion of the sell-off seems driven by accumulation in crypto futures, but market disturbances also contributed during the week. One such disturbance arose from Mt. Gox resuming BTC transfers, which caused fluctuations during the summer. As Bitcoin reached all-time highs, concerns grew that transfers exceeding $2 billion might lead to sales. Additionally, Meitu, often referred to as China's MicroStrategy, decided to liquidate its crypto assets, selling over 900 BTC. This move highlights institutions turning toward profit-taking. Interest in Bitcoin has surged in Asia recently. With accelerating fund flows into the crypto market, consolidation within the cryptocurrency sector may continue in the coming days. The recent downturn threatens to negatively impact the upward trend, despite appearing as an adjustment in futures positions.Will the Trump Rally Continue?Another Bitcoin-related development involves the debate over creating a Bitcoin reserve in the US, with some deeming it unnecessary. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers dismissed the proposal as \"crazy.\" Trump's Bitcoin reserve project excited crypto investors, though its realization seems unlikely. Investors, however, expect the US to avoid selling its Bitcoin holdings during Trump's tenure. This would exert considerable pressure on Bitcoin, especially at current price levels. Trump's presidential victory positively influenced Bitcoin throughout November, but by month's end, this effect seemed complete. In December, a slower news cycle might lead to sideways Bitcoin movement, with investors holding on for new developments. With the market focusing on the US, the Fed's anticipated 25 basis point rate cut this month may help maintain current levels. However, volatility could rise once Trump assumes office in January. It's crucial to prepare for unexpected developments. Monitoring Bitcoin's short-term support and resistance levels is essential.Technical Outlook for BitcoinThe Bitcoin chart shows sideways movement since November 22. Yesterday's sudden price movements can be disregarded as they lack support from daily closes, although they align with Fibonacci levels. We continue observing Bitcoin's upward trend that began in September. During this period, the $92,400 level served as a crucial resistance with a Fib 2.618 value and later became support. Subsequently, the $99,000 level appeared as intermediate resistance. The initial move beyond this resistance extended to the Fib 3.618 value at $104,997. Currently, the $99,000 mark remains the nearest resistance for Bitcoin. Daily closes above this point will prompt close monitoring of the $105,000 level for potential price breakout. In technical terms, the horizontal trend in the short term has reduced the energy of the Stochastic RSI, potentially paving the way for new advances above $100,000 in the coming days. The volume of these purchases will determine the trend's sustainability. However, recent rapid price movements suggest that surpassing $105,000 this month is unlikely. A fresh wave of positive news could quickly alter this perspective. On the downside, we can track the average level of $95,500 as intermediate support. Daily closes below this threshold will open the door for pullbacks toward stronger support at $92,400. From a broader perspective using the weekly chart, Bitcoin maintains its long-term upward trend, with the $105,000 region serving as a critical limit. If the current oscillation since 2023 persists, attempts to reach $105,000 in the short term may encounter selling pressure, potentially pushing Bitcoin into a price cycle that could extend toward $85,000. In summary, Bitcoin's short-term limits appear to be within the $92,400 to $105,000 range. As market volatility increases, these levels will likely be tested. Clear daily breaks of these support and resistance lines will play a crucial role in determining the new direction. *** Subscribe now to InvestingPro to take advantage of the market's top AI-powered stock-picker at a fraction of the cost.

  "title": "Bitcoin ends brief fling with $100 , 000 as Trump announces crypto  czar  ",
  "content": " Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen sharply from the fresh all-time high achieved by the world’s largest cryptocurrency on Thursday. Bitcoin topped out at $104,000 late on Thursday evening before crashing more than 13% lower in the space of five hours. After bottoming out at $90,500, the BTC/USD pair has since settled at around $98,300, where it was trading on the spot markets at the time of writing. President-elect Donald Trump has fuelled the surge in bitcoin’s price. His campaign promises included making the US a crypto hub and building a bitcoin reserve. On Thursday, Trump announced the appointment of former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as his ‘White House A.I. & Crypto Czar’. An ardent Trump supporter who reportedly raised millions for the president-elect’s campaign, Sacks “will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness”, Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump added: “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S. David will also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology…” Trump has also named Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair when current chair Gary Gensler departs in January. Atkins is seen as more sympathetic to crypto than Gensler, who has led numerous high-profile litigations against prominent crypto firms including XRP token developer Ripple Labs during his stint. Bitcoin is currently up 132% year to date. Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 – Source: tradingview.com "

(Samara)Malta, 12.06.2024Samara Asset Group's Net Asset Value per Share reaches €2.69 asBitcoin Crosses $100,000 for the First TimeMalta, Dec. 6, 2024. Samara Asset Group's (ISIN: MT0001770107; Ticker: SRAG:GR) estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) per share reaches €2.69, reflective of an estimated NAV of €246 million, as Bitcoin reaches yet another new all-time high, crossing the mythical $100,000 for the very first time. The spike in NAV was further compounded by the ongoing surge of Northern Data's share price, one of Samara's core portfolio companies, which closed yesterday at €43 per share.The surge in the Bitcoin price has been driven by multiple macro factors, most prominently by a positive investor outlook on the future of crypto in the United States after the re-election of President Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to build a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the United States as well as to turn the U.S., which has historically been an anti-crypto jurisdiction, into a pro-crypto hub for innovation in the sector.The United States does not stand alone in driving the nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, however. The Russian government recently decreed Bitcoin to be legal property in Russia, stating correctly that nobody can ever ban Bitcoin. Russia's decree came shortly after China announced it would become legal to hold and use Bitcoin in the country. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that many more nation-states, as well as individual States within the U.S., will follow the United States' lead and build their own strategic reserves as the global race to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible continues to heat up. While Samara can't compete with many nation-states, it ranks globally among the top 25 largest publicly listed owners of Bitcoin. As of this writing, Samara currently holds approximately 540 Bitcoin.Samara's increase in NAV comes on the heels of a successful issuance of a Nordic Bond (Bond ISIN: NO0013364398), which saw the firm raise €20 million to broaden its portfolio of venture and alternative asset funds as well as acquire more Bitcoin. The successful placement of the bond marks the very first time in history a European firm has taken a page out of the \"MicroStrategy / Michael Saylor Playbook\", issuing a bond with the intent to acquire Bitcoin. With the bond proceeds, Samara successfully acquired roughly 76 additional Bitcoin, which has already netted the firm an unrealized gain of €1.1 million since their purchase. Additionally, the firm has also committed €10.8M to new venture and alternative fund investments with bond proceeds.As of writing, Samara is currently invested as a Limited Partner (LP) in 21 venture and alternative asset funds, diversified across various sectors ranging from biotech and longevity to fintech, AI and blockchain. The bulk of these funds are posted as collateral in an SPV for the Nordic Bond with a gross value of €150 million, reflective of a severe over-collateralization of the Bond with a 13.3% LTV.\"We believe this is just the very beginning of the bull market, not just for Bitcoin, but for the global economy as a whole,\" said Patrick Lowry, Samara CEO. \"We are highly encouraged by market signals we are seeing in crypto and in traditional markets. With our Bitcoin and venture fund investments, Samara is uniquely positioned to capitalize and profit substantially from our investments.\"Christian Angermayer, member of Samara's Advisory Committee, said \"Bitcoin Game Theory is in full swing, and more and more nation states and corporates will adopt Bitcoin as their primary strategic reserve asset, just like Samara has. Couple this with an expectation of de-regulation of various sectors, most notably biotech in the United States, and I believe we have some great years ahead.\"About Samara Asset Group p.l.c.Samara Asset Group (ISIN: MT0001770107; Ticker: SRAG:GR) is the stalwart foundation from which the strongest investment seeds grow.

  "content": " EQS Post-admission Duties announcement: Samara Asset Group p.l.c. / Samara Asset Group’s Net Asset Value per Share reaches €2.69 as Bitcoin Crosses $100,000 for the First Time Samara Asset Group p.l.c.: Release of a capital market information 06.12.2024 / 11:46 CET/CEST Dissemination of a Post-admission Duties announcement transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Samara Asset Group p.l.c. (Samara)Malta, 12.06.2024 Samara Asset Group’s Net Asset Value per Share reaches €2.69 as Bitcoin Crosses $100,000 for the First Time Malta, Dec. 6, 2024. Samara Asset Group’s (ISIN: MT0001770107; Ticker: SRAG:GR) estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) per share reaches €2.69, reflective of an estimated NAV of €246 million, as Bitcoin reaches yet another new all-time high, crossing the mythical $100,000 for the very first time. The spike in NAV was further compounded by the ongoing surge of Northern Data’s share price, one of Samara’s core portfolio companies, which closed yesterday at €43 per share. The surge in the Bitcoin price has been driven by multiple macro factors, most prominently by a positive investor outlook on the future of crypto in the United States after the re-election of President Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to build a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the United States as well as to turn the U.S., which has historically been an anti-crypto jurisdiction, into a pro-crypto hub for innovation in the sector. The United States does not stand alone in driving the nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, however. The Russian government recently decreed Bitcoin to be legal property in Russia, stating correctly that nobody can ever ban Bitcoin. Russia’s decree came shortly after China announced it would become legal to hold and use Bitcoin in the country. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that many more nation-states, as well as individual States within the U.S., will follow the United States’ lead and build their own strategic reserves as the global race to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible continues to heat up. While Samara can’t compete with many nation-states, it ranks globally among the top 25 largest publicly listed owners of Bitcoin. As of this writing, Samara currently holds approximately 540 Bitcoin. Samara’s increase in NAV comes on the heels of a successful issuance of a Nordic Bond (Bond ISIN: NO0013364398), which saw the firm raise €20 million to broaden its portfolio of venture and alternative asset funds as well as acquire more Bitcoin. The successful placement of the bond marks the very first time in history a European firm has taken a page out of the “MicroStrategy / Michael Saylor Playbook”, issuing a bond with the intent to acquire Bitcoin. With the bond proceeds, Samara successfully acquired roughly 76 additional Bitcoin, which has already netted the firm an unrealized gain of €1.1 million since their purchase. Additionally, the firm has also committed €10.8M to new venture and alternative fund investments with bond proceeds. As of writing, Samara is currently invested as a Limited Partner (LP) in 21 venture and alternative asset funds, diversified across various sectors ranging from biotech and longevity to fintech, AI and blockchain. The bulk of these funds are posted as collateral in an SPV for the Nordic Bond with a gross value of €150 million, reflective of a severe over-collateralization of the Bond with a 13.3% LTV. “We believe this is just the very beginning of the bull market, not just for Bitcoin, but for the global economy as a whole,” said Patrick Lowry, Samara CEO. “We are highly encouraged by market signals we are seeing in crypto and in traditional markets. With our Bitcoin and venture fund investments, Samara is uniquely positioned to capitalize and profit substantially from our investments.” Christian Angermayer, member of Samara’s Advisory Committee, said “Bitcoin Game Theory is in full swing, and more and more nation states and corporates will adopt Bitcoin as their primary strategic reserve asset, just like Samara has. Couple this with an expectation of de-regulation of various sectors, most notably biotech in the United States, and I believe we have some great years ahead.” About Samara Asset Group p.l.c. Samara Asset Group (ISIN: MT0001770107; Ticker: SRAG:GR) is the stalwart foundation from which the strongest investment seeds grow. We leverage our robust balance sheet to seed the best emerging asset managers and back the world’s best builders in our unrelenting pursuit of advancing humanity through innovation, and we “hodl” Bitcoin!

  "title": "Nonfarm payrolls , Bitcoin , cash inflows - what moving markets By Investing . com",
  "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street is seen treading water Friday ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly US jobs report for clues of future Federal Reserve policy. Bitcoin slips back below $100,000, and its dominance could be threatened, while investors turn towards cash. 1. Payrolls loom large All eyes Friday will be on the US payrolls data release, due later in the session, for fresh insights into how the economy is faring ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. Economists are expecting the economy to have added 202,000 in November, a sharp rebound from the meager 12,000 jobs added in October after disruptions from strikes and hurricanes resulted in jobs growth being severely constrained. That was the smallest gain since December 2020. Such a rebound is unlikely to alter market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again later this month, especially as US growth slowed in November and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week. But a repeat of September’s blowout jobs report could disrupt expectations for future Fed rate cuts. Financial markets currently see a roughly 70% chance of a 25 basis points rate cut at the US central bank's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, CME's FedWatch tool showed. 2. Futures steady ahead of nonfarm payrolls US stock futures were little changed Friday, with investors wary of committing ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly official jobs report. By 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT), the contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, climbed 3 points, or 0.1%, and rose by 23 points, or 0.1%. The main benchmarks retreated from the previous session’s record levels Thursday, with the leading the way, falling almost 250 points, or 0.6%. Week to date, the broad-based is up 0.7%, the tech-heavy has gained 2.5%, while the DJIA is down marginally. The day’s key focus will be on the nonfarm payrolls release, with investors looking for clues to the health of the US labor market after Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated earlier in the week that the largest economy in the world was strong enough for the central bank to move carefully on rate cuts. On the corporate side, the likes of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:), Gitlab (NASDAQ:) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:) will be in the spotlight after the companies all released well received results after the close on Thursday. 3. Bitcoin dominance to fade? slipped lower Friday, retreating after the breach of the $100,000 mark earlier in the week, and the world’s most popular cryptocurrency dominance could fade. At 03:50 ET, Bitcoin traded 4.3% lower to $98,550.0, still over 1% higher this week. The digital currency surged to record highs this week on optimism over friendlier regulations under Donald Trump, with the most recent The latest point of support coming from Trump nominating pro-crypto lawyer Paul Atkins as the next Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Market capitalization of the whole crypto sector hit a record high of $3.7 trillion on Thursday, but interestingly Bitcoin’s relative share of market capitalization fell to 53.9% by Friday, data from Coinmarketcap showed, after hitting a three-year high, at around 59%, in late November. Analysts at Citi warned that regulatory clarity may erode the coin’s dominance in crypto markets, as it could broaden the asset class’s appeal, fostering strength in coins and tokens beyond Bitcoin. “Over the long-term, we think a network’s utility or value will be related to usage, as well as macro correlations and production costs. A new regulatory regime may unlock further or broader use cases for blockchain assets,” Citi analysts wrote, in a note. 4. Investors turn to cash Uncertainty over whether the recent gains on Wall Street, that have resulted in record closing levels, can continue has seen investors turn to cash this week. A report from Bank of America, published earlier Friday, indicated that investors ploughed $136.4 billion into cash in the week to Wednesday, the biggest weekly inflow since March 2023, when markets were rattled by a regional banking crisis. Buying of U.S. equities continued for the ninth consecutive week, although at a reduced level with inflows of just $8.2 billion of stocks, while investors also bought $4.9 billion of bonds. Crypto got a $3 billion injection, and clocked its largest four-week inflow ever, at $11 billion. 5. Brent on course for weekly loss Oil prices slipped lower Friday, with the global benchmark on course for substantial weekly losses on concerns of slowing demand after OPEC+ extended its current run of supply cuts until well into 2025. By 03:50 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $68.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $71.77 a barrel. For the week, Brent was on track to drop around 1.5%, while WTI hung on to marginal gains. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, delayed the start of its oil output increases by three months until April and extended the full unwinding of cuts by a year until the end of 2026. The group of top producers originally planned to start unwinding cuts from October, but a slowdown in global demand - especially in China - has forced it to postpone the plan several times. The cartel has also repeatedly cut its demand growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025. "

  "title": "Trump Appoints Former PayPal Exec David Sacks as AI and Crypto Czar",
  "content": " US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" another step towards overhauling US policy. \"He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,\" Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether \"czar\" was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape US policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump's tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, called the choice of Sacks a \"strong move\" in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, \"congrats to czar @DavidSacks!\" \"Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails,\" Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters. Jang has co-invested with Sacks in both cryptocurrency and AI startups. He predicted that Sacks will prioritize regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed California's unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump - who once labeled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. \"David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,\" Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the \"PayPal Mafia\" of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. \"It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money,\" he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. "

  "title": "Currency Markets Rattled by U . S . Jobs Report , Political Chaos  All Eyes on December Fed Decision  ",
  "content": " The currency markets remained tense on Friday as traders awaited the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for November while grappling with political upheavals across Europe and Asia. In a week marked by uncertainty, the report is seen as critical for gauging the direction of Federal Reserve policy. Economic Data Drives Market Uncertainty The U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due later on Friday, is expected to show an increase of 200,000 jobs for November, according to a Reuters survey. This follows a dramatic slowdown in October, where job growth hit its lowest level since December 2020. Market analysts are closely monitoring the data to assess the likelihood of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said, “Indicators this week, including private payrolls and jobless claims, suggest payrolls could meet expectations. An on-target report would likely confirm a December interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.” Currently, markets estimate a 72% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting, up from 66.5% a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. However, a stronger-than-expected jobs report could shift the focus to next week’s U.S. inflation data, which may alter the Fed’s trajectory. Political Turmoil Adds to Market Tensions The euro struggled against the dollar on Friday, trading at $1.0582 after rebounding from a three-week low earlier in the week. French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that he would appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, following Barnier's government ousting, added political uncertainty in Europe. Despite the turmoil, the European Central Bank is unlikely to respond directly to political instability when it meets next week. Analysts anticipate the ECB will trim interest rates by 25 basis points on December 12 as it grapples with sluggish economic growth. Meanwhile, in South Korea, the dollar spiked against the won after local media reported rumors of another martial law declaration. The won fell 0.42% to 1419.27 per dollar as political instability kept Korean markets on edge. Authorities have pledged \"unlimited liquidity\" to stabilize financial conditions. In China, the yuan traded flat at 7.2632 against the dollar, extending its 10th consecutive weekly loss amid concerns over U.S. tariffs and Beijing's economic policies. President-elect Donald Trump's recent tariff threats have heightened strains on the Chinese economy, prompting speculation about whether Beijing will ease its grip on the currency to boost exports. Cryptocurrencies and Other Markets Bitcoin retreated from its record high of $103,649, briefly sliding to $98,170, reflecting a volatile week for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the dollar gained 0.32% against the yen, trading at 150.55, as speculation swirled over a potential December rate hike by the Bank of Japan. Elsewhere, the Australian and New Zealand dollars faced declines, with the Australian dollar trading at $0.64285, down 0.37%, and the New Zealand dollar at $0.5854, down 0.52%. Social Media Reactions The week’s developments sparked lively discussions online: @ForexGuru: “All eyes on the U.S. payrolls report. The Fed’s December decision hinges on this data!” @MarketObserverEU: “Political instability in France and South Korea is a wildcard for global markets this week.” @CryptoTracker: “Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride continues! Will it break $100K again, or was this the peak?” @TradeInsights: “Trump’s tariffs could shake up the yuan even more. Watching closely for Beijing’s next move.” @ECBWatchdog: “A December rate cut from the ECB feels inevitable, but will it be enough for Europe?” @StockSignals: “Investors are spooked by uncertainty. Safe-haven assets are looking more attractive by the day.” "

I feel that’s what the market is responding to this morning,” said Graham Priest, investment advisor at BlueShore Financial.Bets for a hefty half-point rate cut stand at 80%, up from 49% seen earlier in the day.The BoC this year has already reduced its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points in a bid to boost economic growth.“We’ve had a very strong performance this year and there does seem to be the expectation that it will continue into 2025,” Priest added. TSX is up 23% for the year.Among sectors, information technology led the gains, rising 2.1%, boosted by a 6.1% jump in e-commerce firm Shopify.The heavyweight financials sector rose 0.4%, buoyed by Laurentian Bank jumping 7.8% after exceeding quarterly profit estimates, and Bank of Montreal gaining 4.2% following an upgrade by CIBC.In contrast, the energy sector fell 2% after oil prices slipped over 1%.Wall Street’s main indexes edged higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching intraday record highs as traders increased bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut this month following robust November payrolls data.U.S. job growth surged in November after being severely constrained by hurricanes and strikes, but this is unlikely to signal a material shift in labor market conditions, which continue to ease steadily and would allow the Fed to cut interest rates again this month.“This jobs report came out right in the Goldilocks zone - not too hot so as to derail interest-rate cuts in December (or next year), but also not too cold, which could have spooked financial markets about the underlying health of the U.S. economy,” said Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst, ClearBridge Investments.Traders boosted bets the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates this month, now signaling a more than 90% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s upcoming Dec. 17-18 meeting, versus 67% before the release of the jobs report.Meanwhile, a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s U.S. consumer sentiment survey stood at 74 in December, compared with an estimate of 73, according to economists polled by Reuters.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49.46 points, or 0.11%, to 44,815.17, the S&P 500 gained 22.11 points, or 0.36%, to 6,097.33, and the Nasdaq Composite added 142.28 points, or 0.72%, to 19,843.00.Most megacap and growth stocks rose, with Tesla and Amazon up 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively, pulling the Consumer Discretionary sector up 1.3% to a record high.Lululemon Athletica also added 17.2% after the Canadian sportswear maker increased its full-year forecasts, betting on resilient demand for its athletic wear.Fed officials including San Francisco President Mary Daly are scheduled to make public appearances through the day, on the eve of a media blackout that kicks in on Saturday in the run-up to the central bank’s Dec. 17-18 policy meeting.U.S. stocks closed lower in the last session, with UnitedHealth down sharply and technology shares giving up some gains after a steady increase through the week.Despite Thursday’s pullback, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were on track for their third consecutive weekly gains, while the blue-chip Dow was set for minor losses.The three indexes have rallied this year as investors bought into heavyweight tech stocks, in a bid to cash in on the euphoria around artificial intelligence.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win in the Nov. 5 election has provided further tailwinds for stocks. Analysts expect his tax-cut policies and looser regulations to support corporate performance.Ulta Beauty advanced 12.1% after the cosmetics retailer raised its annual profit forecast, signaling a revival in demand for perfumes and makeup during the holiday shopping season.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and by a 1.97-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 37 new lows.Reuters"

  "title": "Man steps up legal action as Bitcoin dumped at tip now worth £635million",
  "content": "A man who 'threw away' a Bitcoin fortune has stepped up his fight to retrieve it - after its value soared to a record high £635million. James Howells, 39, has launched court action against a council that has refused to let him excavate computer equipment needed to unlock his 8,000 Bitcoins. The costly error a decade ago saw his then partner throw away a black bin bag containing the drive he needed to gain access to his stash. It has since laid in a rubbish tip run by Newport Council in Wales and he has spent years fighting for the right to retrieve it. And as the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time record high soaring above $102k per unit for the first time - his lost collection is now valued at more than £635million. James appeared in court for the first time this week for the start of legal proceedings he has launched against the council - a move he described as a 'last resort.' During the hearing on Monday, a judge at Cardiff High Court heard submissions on a 'strike out' application made by the council. James' legal team claimed he had a team of experts who could go in and retrieve it with no cost to the public purse - while the council argued it would have a 'negative environmental impact'. Following the hearing in Cardiff, Judge Keyser KC said he would reserve his decision until a later date. If the council application to 'strike out' is not granted it would pave the way for a full two week hearing within the next six months. James has also pledged to donate ten per cent of proceeds back to the local area - an offer that the council's legal term accused of being a \"bribe\" to the council. But speaking before the case, James said the council has continually refused to engage - and had missed the opportunity to turn Newport into the 'Dubai or Las Vegas' of the UK. He said: \"Despite being thrown out by my ex partner, which was a mistake and was without my permission or consent, I still own the intellectual digital property located on the hard drive. I am either entitled to recover the property at full cost to myself or if the landowner refuses they it they pay me the value of my property. \"I would much rather say let's have a conversation and let’s dig and work together amicably - but they don't want to know. I instigated the court action that should take about three to six months. Should I be successful in defeating the 'throw out' application' I will be proceeding within three to six months with a full two week court case. \"It is crazy money that could do so much good for the area.\" James said he didn't want to go down the court route - but claimed a lack of engagement from the council left him no choice. If his team are eventually allowed in he said the final haul would be split between expert recovery teams, businesses and investors. And he also pledged to gift ten per cent to the local community to improve the area. He added: \"The council lives in the dark ages. Newport could have looked like Las Vegas or Dubai if they had the foresight to engage. But they did not understand crypto currency and have refused to learn. \"If they had spoken to me back then about investment in crypto the whole area - the whole of South Wales - could have profited from the rise. But they were not intelligent enough or willing to listen to do so. I have continued to try and engage with them and they've rejected all communication with us.\" James said he has assembled a strong legal team and experts to fight the case. He added: \"In June this year I finally decided to take legal action against Newport Council - this is a last resort. They have continued to ignore my reasonable requests so legal action is the only course I could take. \"The assets are legally owned on their property. I am the owner of those and I have that legal right to retrieve my property. I believe I can do so at no cost or impact to Newport Council - yet they continue to refuse any efforts to engage. I've employed a team that have done multiple landfill excavations - all within environmental guidelines. \"We also have AI experts that have the tech to make the job of finding the needle in the haystack that much easier. I can carry out everything at no cost to the public.\" James said although the claim is for around £500M he said all Bitcoin needs to do is hit £125k and it would break through the billion pound barrier. Newport City Council said: \"Newport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to be in our landfill site. \"The council has told Mr. Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area. The council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site. \"Mr. Howells's claim has no merit, and the council is vigorously resisting it.\"Story SavedYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right."

  "title": "From outsider to the Oval Office , bitcoin surges as a new administration embraces crypto | News , Sports , Jobs",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington’s ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it’s Washington’s very embrace of bitcoin that’s helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers. Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who’s seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto. It’s the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States “the crypto capital of the planet.” The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen. It’s a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year’s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization. Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin’s early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn’t be beholden to any government or financial institution. In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet “works well enough for most transactions.” But, Nakamoto said, it “still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,” where a third party like a bank needs to process payments. Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” That is what became the bitcoin network. Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of “digital gold,” or a way to store value in something that’s not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank. In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it’s also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts. Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as “crypto winters” that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX. With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who’s about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. “$100,000!!!

France’s CAC 40 saw an early trading increase of 0.4% to 7,357.30 after French President Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to remain in office until the end of his term and appoint a new prime minister within days. This follows the approval of a no-confidence motion by far-right and left-wing lawmakers over budget disputes, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet. Germany’s DAX remained relatively unchanged at 20,357.73, while Britain’s FTSE 100 saw a slight decrease of 0.1% to 8,344.48. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. The key event for markets this week will be Friday’s jobs report from the US government, revealing the number of hires and layoffs last month. A report on Thursday indicated that the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits increased last week but remains at historically healthy levels. In Asian trading, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell by 0.8% to 39,091.17. The US dollar rose to 150.35 Japanese yen from 150.10 yen. Chinese stocks rallied with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong adding 1.6% to 19,865.85 and the Shanghai Composite index surging 1.1% to 3,404.08. Markets are keeping a close eye on the outcome of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. Analysts have suggested that policymakers may err on the side of caution as they prepare for President-elect Donald Trump's potential actions on tariffs and trade. South Korea’s Kospi fell by 0.6% to 2,428.16. On Friday, the leader of South Korea’s ruling party expressed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked it earlier this week. Yoon is now facing calls to resign and be investigated, with impeachment a possibility. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, and thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s largest labour groups, began partial strikes on Thursday in protest against Yoon. The union has stated that its members will commence indefinite strikes from Wednesday if Yoon does not step down by then. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.6% to 8,420.90. Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 on Thursday before retreating after exceeding $100,000 for the first time following President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of financier Paul Atkins, who is viewed as a crypto advocate, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin was trading at 98,670.46 early on Friday. On Thursday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, but it is still on track to close out one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before. Strong consumer spending has kept the US economy afloat, staving off a recession that seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to tackle inflation. However, shoppers are now grappling with persistently high prices and a decelerating job market. There is widespread anticipation that the Fed will once again reduce its primary interest rate in its pre-Christmas meeting. The Fed started lowering its main interest rate from a 20-year peak in September, aiming to provide additional support for the job market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slightly decreased to 4.17% from 4.18% late Wednesday. On Friday, benchmark US crude dropped 22 cents to $68.08 a barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, remained steady at $72.09 a barrel. The euro marginally fell to $1.0577 from $1.0589."

  "title": "Bitcoin hitting a record $104 , 091 is nothing short of remarkable - London Business News",
  "content": " Christoph Hardt/Geisler-Fotopres / DPA Picture Alliance / Avalon Bitcoin’s ascent past the psychological $100,000 mark to a record $104,091 was nothing short of remarkable, but the levels didn’t hold and we saw sellers play out all through US trade, culminating in a liquidity vacuum on the roll to Asia with price collapsing 6k before retracing the falls. The surge was fueled by a confluence of robust capital inflows and bullish news, while the pullback underscored the risks of market-wide liquidations. Institutional players remain pivotal in driving this rally. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen four consecutive days of net inflows, with a jaw-dropping $676 million recorded in just a single day. Industry heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have been key contributors, reinforcing Bitcoin’s growing appeal to institutional investors. On the regulatory front, optimism surged following Trump’s announcement of Paul Atkins as the next SEC chairman. Atkins, seen as a crypto advocate compared to Gensler, has heightened expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework starting in 2025, injecting fresh enthusiasm into the market. Adding to the positive momentum, Russia’s increasing crypto adoption has been a game-changer. Putin’s recent legislation recognizing digital currencies as property and exempting mining and sales from VAT has set a progressive tone. His pointed remarks on reducing foreign exchange reserves while showing a keen interest in Bitcoin have further bolstered sentiment. Looking ahead, the focus is squarely on whether Bitcoin can reclaim $100,000 after this correction. I see the pullback as a healthy consolidation driven by short-term profit-taking. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which peaked at an extreme greed level of 84 yesterday, has eased to a more sustainable 72, indicating a much-needed reset. The long lower shadows on recent candlesticks also signal that bulls remain resilient, preparing for another push higher. The broader backdrop remains supportive. With strong performance in U.S. equities, solid economic data, and sustained institutional engagement, the case for further upside remains compelling. However, the road ahead isn’t without risks: Policy uncertainty: While Atkins’ nomination has sparked hope, Trump’s presidency doesn’t officially begin until January 2025. This transitional period may lead to profit-taking as institutions adopt a wait-and-see approach. Leverage risks: Open interest in Bitcoin futures has hit a record 626,100 BTC, according to Coinglass, underscoring the heavy reliance on leverage. While it has amplified gains, it also leaves the market vulnerable to sharp reversals if liquidation triggers emerge. Bitcoin’s volatility remains its hallmark. While the potential for growth is undeniable, navigating these risks will be crucial for traders and investors alike. Leave a Comment "

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday. India's Nifty 50 slipped around 0.1% on the country's interest rate decision, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed roughly 1.3%. India's central bank keeps ratesThe Reserve Bank of India on Friday left interest rates unchanged at 6.5%, as economists in a Reuters poll had expected. The central bank is balancing India's high inflation and a slowing economy: year-on-year prices rose 6.21% in October, while the country's fiscal third-quarter gross domestic product grew by a surprisingly low 5.4% from a year ago. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. Crypto continues riding wavesOn Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $98,100. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's announcement on Thursday that venture investor David Sacks will be the White House's \"A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" investor sentiment toward bitcoin might get another boost. [PRO] Top global picks for 2025Investment bank Macquarie is bullish on several Asian stocks for the next year. Those companies span sectors from automotive to defense and have a potential upside of at least 50%, according to the bank. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

Money market funds absorbed $136.4 billion in the week to December 4, marking the largest weekly inflow since March. Stocks attracted $8.2 billion, bonds $4.9 billion, and crypto $3 billion, while $400 million exited gold, according to a Bank of America note citing EPFR Global data. Most notably, crypto funds achieved their largest-ever four-week inflow of $11 billion, reflecting renewed investor appetite for digital assets following Donald Trump’s win in the recent US election. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at BofA, flagged signs of \"froth\" in crypto markets as Bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeded $2 trillion, making it the 11th largest economy globally. Similarly, concerns about equity valuations were highlighted, with the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio at 5.3, surpassing the peak seen in March 2000. Hartnett warned that the risk of an \"overshoot\" in the in Q1 2024 is “high,” citing potential moves toward 6,666 on the index as the US dollar breaks parity with the . On macro, the strategist said the Federal Reserve will likely ease rates at its meeting on Dec. 18 unless November US payrolls exceed 275,000 and Average Hourly Earnings (AHE) grow by more than 0.3%. Regionally, US equities posted their ninth consecutive week of inflows at $8.2 billion, while emerging markets saw inflows resume with $600 million. On the other hand, European equities experienced their tenth straight week of outflows at $5.1 billion, and Japanese equities recorded their third consecutive week of outflows at $600 million. In fixed income, investment-grade bonds extended their streak to 58 weeks of inflows, garnering $7.3 billion. High-yield bonds added $500 million, maintaining a 17-week streak of inflows. Treasury funds, however, resumed outflows, losing $4.4 billion, while emerging market debt and TIPS also saw outflows of $300 million each. Bank loans attracted $1.1 billion, marking their ninth straight week of inflows, and municipal bonds added $100 million, maintaining a 23-week streak."

Over the week, the index looked set for a gain, having risen 0.3% since Monday. A lack of any major movers saw Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) top Friday’s fallers after both receiving downgrades by Jefferies analysts. Both were bumped from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’ ratings ahead of final proposals from regulator Ofwat this month on price controls and investment requirements for the coming years. Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS) also sat among the losers as investors appeared unimpressed with a bid to acquire Norwegian sporting goods retailer XXL.

Coastal areas of Wales and the South West have been hit with the “danger to life” warning, which will run over the course of Saturday morning. Amber warnings have been issued to surrounding regions by the Met Office, with yellow cautions stretching across vast expanses of the UK. Ahead of the storm’s arrival, Go.Compare spokesperson Tom Banks warned over driving in the worst-hit areas. “We would always recommend to avoid using in the car, unless absolutely necessary,” he said. Banks noted car insurance policies would not be invalidated but that “exceptions” may well be made. “Your car insurance will cover you as normal but if your insurer thinks you were driving irresponsibly or recklessly during a red weather warning, and you had an accident, it might not pay out your claim,” he added. “For example, if you drive in an area that has been closed by the police because of flooding and your car got damaged, your claim could be refused.” 2.43pm: US stocks open higher as rate cut hopes grow Wall Street was in a positive mood after non-farm payroll figures showed the addition of 127,000 jobs across the US economy in November on Friday. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 opened 0.3% higher, while the Dow Jones ticked up 0.2%. Markets had been braced for the non-farm payroll figures, which exceeded expectations, as the debate around whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest this month went on. Futures markets were pricing in an 89% chance of a December rate cut in the wake of the data, compared to 68% beforehand. “A strong November non-farm payrolls at 227,000 included some reversals from October and was further offset by a tick up in the unemployment rate to 4.24%,” Janus Henderson Investors’ Adam Hetts commented. “This big rebound from a distorted October read is actually quite balanced, should relieve some economic concerns, and keep the 18 December rate cut expectations on track. “Zooming out a bit from today, the trend of a slowly slowing labour market continues to sit in the sweet spot as far as rate cuts are concerned.” 1.56pm: Pound jumps against dollar on US job figures Sterling racked up a gain against the dollar in the wake of figures showing the addition of 227,000 jobs to the US economy last month. The pound jumped to $1.2806 for a 0.36% rise over the day versus the greenback after news of the expectation-beating figure. Charles Schwab UK managing director Richard Flynn noted the data added to a string of figures showing resilience within the US economy and supported the view that the Federal Reserve could hold interest at its next meeting this month. 1.45pm: Federal Reserve could hold interest after jobs beat - analyst Expectation-beating non-farm payroll figures for November could leave the Federal Reserve inclined to hold interest rates later this month. Some 227,000 jobs were added to the US economy in November, against an upwardly revised 36,000 in October and against expectations for 200,000. Charles Schwab UK managing director Richard Flynn noted the figures added to “the recent spate of resilient economic data” in the US. “The economy has reached a point where it is growing healthily, with fairly full employment, and consistent wage growth,” he said. “We are seeing very little evidence that there are issues needing to be addressed. “Hope to preserve this period of calm may encourage the Fed to lean towards a ‘hold’ decision at its next meeting, particularly amidst uncertainty around how the upcoming change in government will impact the economy.” 1.35pm: US non-farm payrolls ahead of expectations The US economy added 227,000 jobs over the course of November, non-farm payroll figures showed on Friday. Expectations had been for the addition of 200,000 jobs, with the surge marking a bounceback after October’s upwardly revised reading of 36,000. Unemployment ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2% as expected in the meantime, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported. Futures showed Wall Street little moved on the news, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all seen in the red. 1.22pm: BoE official warns high interest hurting economy Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Swati Dhingra has cautioned that high interest rates are taking their toll on the economy. Dhingra, who has been consistently dovish since joining the rate-setting committee in September 2022, warned economic growth would be muted unless the bank opted to cut interest further from 4.75% at its next meeting this month. “We’re really paying the price,” she told Bloomberg TV. “Consumption has been very weak [and] businesses have been telling us for months that they’ve reduced investment. “So it’s a combination of all of those factors, the weak consumption, the weak investment, and possible damage to supply capacity is what I would worry about. “That’s why I think we should be easing policy more.” Dhingra signalled she would vote in favour of cutting rates at the bank’s next meeting on December 19, after November saw the committee vote eight to one for a 25 basis point reduction. 12.46pm: Frasers leads FTSE 100 fallers Acquisition-hungry Sports Direct owner Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS)’s bid to acquire all outstanding shares in Norwegian sporting goods retailer XXL has not gone down well with some factinons of Frasers’ investor base. Frasers is the biggest faller among the FTSE 100 set, dipping 2.6% a the time of writing. The proposed acquisition, if completed, values XXL at approximately 246.36 million Norwegian kroner (£17.5 million), offering a fairly underwhelming 25% premium over the company’s closing share price yesterday. The bid is “classic Frasers behaviour”, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “The approach is similar to Mulberry in that Frasers has fiercely criticised XXL’s fundraising efforts, this time implying the Norwegian retailer is making a bad decision with a reworked rights issue. “A proposed 25% bid premium isn’t generous yet XXL is on its knees and Frasers is factoring in high risks associated with the company,” he added. Frasers shares are currently swapping for 645p. The broader FTSE 100 set is currently down four points to 8,345. 12.09am: Mortgage rates fall every day of week as NatWest cuts Mortgage rates fell every day over the course of the week as NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) was among major lenders to scale back prices. According to Moneyfacts, interest on the average two-year fixed mortgage rate fell below the 5.5% mark once again, having sat at 5.4% in early November. Come Friday, interest on the typical two-year fix was at 5.4894%, against 5.5197% a week ago. NatWest on Thursday announced cuts of up to 0.39% across its two and five-year fixed rate mortgage products. Coventry Building Society then said on Friday that rates on all of its fixed rate mortgages would be reduced, including cuts of as much as 0.26% on residential deals. “This week has been mostly positive,” Orchard Financial Advisers managing director Ben Perks commented. “For the first time since the Budget, we’ve seen more reductions than increases. “It definitely feels like the winds are changing and hopefully they’ll continue to do so.” 11.27am: Nasdaq to fall as caution seen on Wall Street ahead of non-farm payrolls Wall Street appeared in a cautious mood ahead of Friday’s all-important non-farm payroll figures. Futures had the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all down by 0.1% ahead of the opening bell. Following the addition of just 12,000 jobs across the US economy through October, attention has been drawn to Friday’s figures for November. “Markets are hoping for a balanced outcome,” Tickmill Group partner Patrick Munnelly commented. “Not too strong to undermine the likelihood of a rate cut, nor too weak to spark concerns about economic health.” Expectations are for 200,000 jobs to have been added to the US economy over the month, with unemployment anticipated to come in at 4.2%, against 4.1% previously. 11.15am: Eurozone economy grows faster in third quarter Eurozone gross domestic product growth picked up over the third quarter, figures showed on Friday. GDP across the euro area climbed by 0.4% in the three months to September, against 0.2% over the previous quarter, a final reading from Eurostat showed. On an annual basis, the economy grew by 0.9%, following the second quarter’s 0.5% uptick. Germany, the continent’s largest economy, contracted by 0.3% against a year earlier though, while French GDP climbed by 1.2% in the meantime. 11.10am: Direct Line shares up 7% Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) shares remain well bid following an agreement to be taken over by FTSE 100 insurance giant Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.). The proposed combination includes 129.7p in cash and the rest in new Aviva shares, plus a 5p dividend payment subject to board approval. Aviva’s offer represents a 73.3% premium to Direct Line’s closing share price on November 27, when Aviva approached the group with its first, rejected takeover proposal. Direct Line shares proceeded to rally 7% to 252.2p at the time of writing. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, suggested that shareholders could push for a higher valuation, although “judging by recent City chatter, 275p should be enough to keep everyone happy and Aviva might be able to wrap this up fairly quickly”. “Aviva has performed every step of the takeover dance flawlessly. It’s spotted a rival going through a weak phase and thrown its hat into the ring as an interested buyer with a low-ball price to test the water. “It will have almost certainly known the first bid would have been rejected and it’s now come back with a higher and fairer offer, and Direct Line’s board has indicated it’s good enough. 10.41am: Morning commute chaos The morning commute was thrown into disarray this morning following a “nationwide fault” in National Rail’s communication system. Train drivers flagged a fault with the radio system, causing cancellations and delays as a manual solution was cobbled together. “There is a nationwide fault with the communication system used between train drivers and signallers. As a result, some services across the National Rail network may be subject to delays this morning,” National Rail said in a statement. “This issue is mainly affecting trains registering to enter their route for the start of service and deregistering to end their service. Once trains are underway, they are able to run normally at normal speeds. Short-notice cancellations and alterations are expected due to the knock-on effect on the timetables. Please check before you travel, allow extra time for your journey and monitor live departure boards.” The Northern, Elizabeth and South Western Railway lines are most affected, said Northern Rail. 10.14am: Berkeley shares down Shares in FTSE 100-listed hosuebuilder Berkeley Group Holdings PLC (LSE:BKG) are off more than 1.5% today following an interim trading update. In a statement, Berkeley disclosed that transaction volumes in the current 2025 financial year “remain around a third lower” than two years prior. Berkeley acknowledged that “whilst we have seen a slight uptick in recent weeks, a meaningful recovery will require a sustained improvement in consumer confidence and stability in the wider macroeconomic environment”. Berkeley saw a high-single-digit yearly decrease in pre-tax profit to £275.1 million and a 5.8% dip on basic earnings per share in the first half. Shares were trading at 4,096p each at the time of writing. 9.58am: Bitcoin falls from all-time high Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen sharply from the fresh all-time high achieved by the world’s largest cryptocurrency on Thursday. Bitcoin topped out at $104,000 late on Thursday evening before crashing more than 13% lower in the space of five hours. After bottoming out at $90,500, the BTC/USD pair has since settled at around $98,300, where it was trading on the spot markets at the time of writing. On Thursday, Trump announced the appointment of former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as his ‘White House A.I. & Crypto Czar’. An ardent Trump supporter who reportedly raised millions for the president-elect’s campaign, Sacks “will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness”, Trump wrote on Truth Social. 9.27am: Stamp duty deadline fuelling housing demand - analysts Demand for housing is being fuelled by hurried buying ahead of a drop in stamp duty thresholds next April, analysts have pointed out. Halifax on Friday reported a 4.8% jump in average house prices to a record £298,083 in the year to November, which marked the fastest growth since the same month in 2022. Analysts pointed to the looming deadline for a reversal in temporarily lifted stamp duty thresholds as a key reason behind surging demand. “Hesitation has turned to hurry in some parts of the market, especially among first-time buyers racing to complete their purchases before the stamp duty thresholds change,” Garrington Property Finders chief executive Jonathan Hopper commented. “This sense of urgency is prompting some buyers to view in haste and offer high in order to secure a home now and complete their purchase before the tax changes take effect.” The stamp duty threshold is due to fall from £250,000 to £125,000 come April 1 following confirmation in the Budget. First time buyers will pay the tax on properties worth over £300,000 in the meantime, against £425,000 previously. “It means property prices are likely to rise in the run-up to the deadline as buyers and sellers race to beat the tax hike,” Bestinvest analyst Alice Haine added. “Beyond the start of April, the market is likely to be more muted as buyers choose to purchase cheaper homes to reduce their tax bill or negotiate more aggressively to afford their desired property.” 9.06am: CBI scales back economic growth forecast after Budget The Confederation of British Industry has cut forecasts for UK economic growth and warned of investment and hiring setbacks in the wake of October’s Budget. Economic growth of 0.9% was predicted for 2024, against its previous forecast for 1.0%, while its expectation for next year was dialled down from 1.9% to 1.6%. “Measures in the autumn Budget will increase firms’ costs at a time when their profit margins have already been under pressure,” chief economist Louise Hellem said. “Many businesses have told us that these measures will likely push up prices and weigh on their hiring and investment plans going forward.” Inflation was forecast to average 2.6% through 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as the likes of hospitality and retail price growth provided upward pressure. 8.48am: Quiz sheds 50% after funding warning Quiz PLC (AIM:QUIZ) spiralled 50% on Friday after the omni-channel fashion firm warned it may need further funding early next year. Shares dropped 50.7% to 2.64p in the wake of the update, where Quiz pointed to a “marked decline” in both online and in-store traffic through November. Additional funding would likely be needed in early 2025 in “the absence of a material improvement to trading during the important pre-and-post-Christmas period,” Quiz said... Read more 8.35am: Direct Line surges, leads FTSE 250 higher Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) surged on Friday morning after accepting a takeover bid by Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.), leading the FTSE 250 higher. Shares jumped 7.8% to 253.64p in the wake of the news that it had agreed to the 275p per share offer. Molten Ventures PLC (LSE:GROW), Metro Bank Holdings PLC (LSE:MTRO) and Dr Martens PLC (LSE:DOCS) were also among those climbing on the FTSE 250. Overall, the index edged one point higher, placing it as an outlier in London early on while the likes of the FTSE 100, down 12 points, fell. 8.28am: Berkeley dips as transaction volumes slump Berkeley Group Holdings PLC (LSE:BKG) shares moved lower on Friday morning after the FTSE 100-listed housebuilder warned of a slump in transaction volumes. Transaction volumes in the current 2025 financial year “remain around a third lower” than two years prior, it said in an interim update. The company acknowledged that “whilst we have seen a slight uptick in recent weeks, a meaningful recovery will require a sustained improvement in consumer confidence and stability in the wider macroeconomic environment”... Read more Shares slipped 0.4% to 4,148p. 8.20am: Thames Water last-minute bid could see break-up, listing Thames Water has reportedly received a last-minute takeover bid which would see the UK’s largest water supplier broken up and listed on the stock exchange. British infrastructure investor Covalis tabled an offer ahead of Thursday’s deadline for indicative bids, according to the Financial Times. Some £1 billion would be paid upfront, before a further £4 billion was raised through sales of Thames’ assets, refinancing and a stock market listing. Billions of pounds worth of Thames’ assets could be sold, potentially including entire regions, as new owners worked to cut its near-£19 billion debt pile and stave off cash woes. France’s Suez had also penned a deal with Covalis to aid the break-up but would not own any shares, with the UK government set to receive a seat on Thames’ board. Hong Kong-based Northumbrian Water owner CK Infrastructure Holdings and Castle Water, co-owned by Conservative treasurer Graham Edwards, are also reportedly in the running as potential bidders for the crisis-hit supplier. 8.05am: FTSE 100 just on the front foot London’s blue chips racked up an ever-so-slight gain as trading got underway on Friday, climbing one point to 8,351. Banks were among those in the green early on in the absence of any major movers, while Spirax Group PLC and Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS) led fallers. 7.59am: Direct Line agrees to boosted Aviva bid Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) has preliminary agreed to an enlarged takeover bid by Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.). The 275p per share offer represents a 73.3% premium to its closing price on November 27 and includes 129.7p in cash and the rest in new Aviva shares, plus a 5p dividend payment subject to board approval. Direct Line rejected the initial offer, with the motor and home insurer calling it a \"highly opportunistic” bid that “substantially undervalued the company\"... Read more 7.56am: Quiz warns further funding may be needed Quiz PLC (AIM:QUIZ) has warned it may need further funding by early next year after a drop in footfall and online traffic hit sales in recent months. Both online and in-store traffic suffered a “marked decline” during the important trading month of November, the omni-channel fashion firm said on Friday. Revenue slipped by £1.5 million to £24.9 million in its latest quarter as a result, and was down 8.6% over the eight months to November at £52.2 million. This was behind management’s expectations, with Quiz pointing to uncertainty around both the impact from November’s Black Friday and October’s Budget on trading. “In the absence of either a material improvement to trading during the important pre-and-post-Christmas period [...] the board anticipates that additional funding will be required by the group in the first quarter of 2025,” Quiz said. 7.25am: House prices new high after strongest growth in two years House prices have hit a new record high after November saw the strongest growth in two years. According to Halifax, the typical house now costs £298,083, after prices increased by 4.8% over the year to November for the largest uptick since the same month in 2022. Month on month, prices ticked up by 1.3%, marking the fifth consecutive positive reading. “Latest figures continue to show improving levels of demand for mortgages, as an easing in mortgage rates boost buyer confidence,” Halifax mortgages head Amanda Bryden said. Wider economic issues and pressed affordability threatened this, she warned, though positive employment data and further declines in mortgage rates should buoy demand. “This should underpin further house price growth, albeit at a modest pace as borrowing costs remain above the average of a few years ago,” Bryden added. 7.12am: Index to reverse on gains Futures had the FTSE 100 largely reversing on Thursday’s 13-point gain ahead of trading, with London’s blue-chip index seen 8 points lower at 8,355. Overnight, Asian markets were mixed, with Chinese stocks climbing but Japan’s Nikkei among those to fall. Attention over the week has been on Friday and its US non-farm payrolls report, due later in the day. Back in London, news house prices had climbed further to a record high through November was the early focus. 5.00am: Friday's schedule House price data from the UK and US non-farm payroll figures are due on Friday, while Berkeley will be among those to report. Expectations are for another uptick in house prices through November after Zoopla reported growth of 1.5% in the year to October. Non-farm payrolls will be in focus later, with markets predicting the addition of 218,000 jobs across the US economy in November. Just 12,000 roles were added through October, while unemployment is anticipated to have remained unchanged at 4.1%.

  "content": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks will serve as White House artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency czar in his incoming administration.Sacks, 52, is a San Francisco-based venture capitalist and one of several prominent Silicon Valley players that backed Trump, 78, during his 2024 campaign.“In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,” the president-elect said in his announcement on Truth Social.President-elect Donald Trump named ex-PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks to be his White House artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency czar. The Washington Post via Getty ImTrump noted that Sacks will be tasked with making the US “the clear global leader” in crypto and AI and protecting the country from censorship.“He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” the president-elect said. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.”Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology as part of his role.Trump praised Sacks as “an extremely successful entrepreneur and investor,” noting his early involvement in PayPal, an online payment system, and Yammer, a workplace communication service that was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion.“David has the knowledge, business experience, intelligence, and pragmatism to MAKE AMERICA GREAT in these two critical technologies,” the 45th president declared.Trump said, “In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,” Getty ImagesSacks publicly endorsed Trump in June, arguing in a lengthy X post that “voters have experienced four years of President Trump and four years of President Biden … with respect to economic policy, foreign policy, border policy, and legal fairness, Trump performed better.”The venture capitalist subsequently hosted a $12 million fundraiser for Trump at his San Francisco home, and the president-elect later appeared on Sack’s “All In” podcast.Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, ballooned to above $100,000 for the first time in its 15 year history Thursday, prior to Trump naming Sack’s as crypto czar, on expectations that the incoming president’s administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for the alternative currency.On Thursday, Trump also tapped former Sen.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday. India's Nifty 50 slipped around 0.1% on the country's interest rate decision, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed roughly 1.3%. India's central bank keeps ratesThe Reserve Bank of India on Friday left interest rates unchanged at 6.5%, as economists in a Reuters poll had expected. The central bank is balancing India's high inflation and a slowing economy: year-on-year prices rose 6.21% in October, while the country's fiscal third-quarter gross domestic product grew by a surprisingly low 5.4% from a year ago. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. Crypto continues riding wavesOn Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $98,100. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's announcement on Thursday that venture investor David Sacks will be the White House's \"A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" investor sentiment toward bitcoin might get another boost. [PRO] Top global picks for 2025Investment bank Macquarie is bullish on several Asian stocks for the next year. Those companies span sectors from automotive to defense and have a potential upside of at least 50%, according to the bank. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

  "content": " Here, we explore ONDO’s future potential and provide long-term outlook for its market performance, which will help you in making weighted investment decisions. Key Takeaways Ondo Finance has a market cap of $1.35B, and the native token, ONDO, has a market value of $0.96. With a trading volume of $176M, the ONDO price shows a recovery rally gradually gaining momentum. Based on the Ondo Finance forecast, bulls will reach a new all-time high at $4.77 in 2025. The key growth factors of Ondo Finance are the rising adoption of tokenized real-world assets, the growth of DeFi space, innovative product offerings over FLUX Finance, etc. Ondo Finance is a DeFi primitive that helps users get staking rewards or yield rewards on crypto and tokenized real-world assets. As the cryptocurrency market grows, the role of Ondo in the mainstream market will expand and help transition the centralized space into a safe, decentralized network. In this ONDO price prediction, we will deal with the upcoming price movements in relation to the broader cryptocurrency market sentiments and global economic conditions. Overview of Ondo Ondo Finance is a DeFi primitive and a permissionless protocol providing a peer-to-pool interaction. Known for providing institutional grade financial products, ONDO also provides a gateway to digital assets. With a strategic partnership with FLUX Finance, Ondo Finance provides yield-generation facilities for crypto assets. Meanwhile, the tokenization of US government treasuries is a prime example of a tokenized real-world asset. However, the rising KYC norms over the decentralized finance platform are a rising topic of discussion among DeFi traders. Photo: TradingView The ONDO tokens were launched in January 2024 and have been moving along with the market sentiments. With the early 2024 bull run, the ONDO token price surged from the listing price of $0.0799 and peaked at $1.48 on June 3. This marks the highest price ever for ONDO Finance. Meanwhile, the lowest price remains $0.0799. Following the pullback phase in the third quarter, the ONDO price retested the $0.60 support level. Over the past November, the ONDO price regained bullish momentum with a potential double-bottom reversal and increased nearly 72% with three consecutive bullish candles. The bullish rally surpassed the $1 psychological mark and peaked at $1.1210. However, with the broader market pullback, the ONDO token price is down by 8.72% this week and has lost the $1 psychological support. It is trading at ONDO $1.68 24h volatility: 3.5% Market cap: $2.41 B Vol. 24h: $493.10 M and has nearly undermined last week’s recovery. ONDO Price Forecast for December 2024 With a bullish recovery rally in November 2024, the Ondo Finance price forecast for December is bullish. The broader market sentiment remains bullish as investors anticipate Bitcoin BTC $99 317 24h volatility: 1.4% Market cap: $1.97 T Vol. 24h: $146.75 B to cross the $100,000 barrier. Hence, the current ONDO finance sentiment bolsters the possibility of an uptrend. Photo: TradingView The daily chart shows the Ondo price trend, showcasing a crucial resistance level breakout rally that is gaining momentum. The resistance level remained at $0.90, slightly before the $1 psychological mark. This has kept the Ondo price trapped below since August 2024. With months of consolidation finally giving a bullish breakout, the uptrend will likely reclaim its 52-week high near the $1.48 level. Hence, the maximum price of Ondo in December 2024 will reach the $1.60 mark. On the flip side, strong support at the $1 psychological mark will likely remain in December. This sets the average price of ONDO at $1.30.

Furthermore, with the rising interest in real-world asset tokenization, Ondo Finance will witness widespread adoption in the traditional finance world. Furthermore, as it gives exposure to the crypto assets, Ondo Finance’s position to provide a hedge against inflation will influence the demand for the Ondo Token. Hence, as a DeFi primitive, Ondo Finance’s role will lead the growing field of decentralized finance. Hence, in the Trump administration, Ondo Finance’s price will peak at $9.54. However, the price fluctuations will lead to a potential low in ONDO’s price at $6.30. Hence, Ondo Finance’s price prediction for 2026 estimates an average price of $7.92.

The market sentiments will witness a quick decline despite the growing adoption of Ondo Finance at the grassroots level. Furthermore, the rising inflation and interest rates hamper the recovery rally, indirectly affecting the adoption phase and resulting in declining network activity. As the trading volume and the total value locked over the ONDO finance network recedes, the maximum Ondo price will be limited to $8.10. However, the intensity of the downfall can be understood with the potential low of Ondo Finance at $5.35 in 2027. Thus, the average price of Ondo will be at $6.73.

This is due to the broader market correction and the increased FUD among the crypto investors. Amid the broader market pullback, the lowest price of Ondo in 2028 is expected at $4.55. However, the broader market recovery driven by the hype around Bitcoin’s 4th halving will drive Ondo Finance’s price. Hence, the Ondo Price Forecast estimates a peak at $6.89 in 2028. Thus, the average price of Ondo is expected at $5.72.

After the fourth Bitcoin halving, driving the hype in the crypto segment, the DeFi players are likely to lead the rally. Despite emerging DeFi protocols, the Ondo market capitalization is likely to recover some of the lost value. Furthermore, the supportive regulations for DeFi adoption will boost Ondo’s price in 2029. The maximum value of Ondo can reach $6.89 and $17.16. Meanwhile, the potential low in the Ondo Finance price is forecast at $11.44. Thus, the average price of Ondo in 2029 is expected at $14.30.

Thus, the ONDO price forecast expects the maximum price in 2030 to be $34.32. Conversely, the lowest price of Ondo is expected at $22.88, resulting in an average price of $28.60. Month Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) January 22.88 25.70 30.80 February 23.20 25.95 30.65 March 23.75 26.20 31.10 April 24.12 26.45 31.60 May 24.60 27.10 32.20 June 25.00 27.55 32.55 July 25.42 28.10 33.00 August 25.75 28.40 33.20 September 26.10 28.70 33.50 October 26.75 29.10 33.75 November 27.30 29.30 34.15 December 28.60 29.75 34.32 ONDO Price Prediction: Estimate for 2031 Unlike institutional investors, who fuel the trading volume, global adoption at the grassroots level will pump the total crypto market cap. Amid a new bull cycle, the ONDO Finance price prediction expects key drivers to be the tokenization of government bonds and other centralized finance instruments. As the ONDO finance market grows beyond geopolitical borders, the new maximum value is expected at $41.18. In case the ONDO foundation witnesses a slippage at a global level or a network fluctuation, ONDO cryptocurrency will register the lowest point at $27.26. Thus, the ONDO prediction of the average price in 2031 is $34.32.

The estimated ecosystem growth and the market conditions predict an optimistic target. Further, ONDO Finance is likely to secure partnerships with rising nations willing to adopt the DeFi segment in the coming decade. Hence, by the fundamental analysis of the coming age, an age of blockchain technology, ONDO’s price will reach a peak at $49.42. However, the broader market fluctuations will keep the minimum ONDO finance price at $32.94 during the Q3 downfall. Thus, the average ONDO’s price is expected at $41.18. Month Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) January 32.94 36.10 44.00 February 33.10 36.80 44.30 March 33.45 37.30 44.30 April 33.85 38.10 45.20 May 34.20 38.55 45.70 June 34.75 39.25 46.20 July 35.20 39.85 46.60 August 35.60 40.20 47.10 September 36.10 41.00 48.00 October 36.60 41.18 48.90 November 37.10 41.18 49.10 December 41.18 41.18 49.42 ONDO Price Prediction: 2033 Analysis By the end of 2033, the ONDO price analysis shows a continuation in the growth trajectory while maintaining dominance at key support levels. As long-term success grows, the ONDO prediction for 2033 highlights the strategic partnerships and unique DeFi offerings driving the then 52-week high at $62.79. Conversely, the flip side will witness a downfall to the annual low at $41.877. Hence, by the end of 2033, the average price will be $52.33. Month Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) January 41.87 46.20 56.50 February 42.40 47.00 57.20 March 42.90 47.80 58.00 April 43.35 48.30 58.75 May 43.80 48.85 59.40 June 44.25 49.35 59.80 July 44.70 50.15 60.50 August 45.15 50.60 61.20 September 45.60 51.10 61.85 October 46.05 51.85 62.40 November 46.50 52.20 62.70 December 47.00 52.33 62.79 ONDO Price Prediction: 2040 Overview By the end of 2040, the cryptocurrency markets will pump to new levels based on various factors. However, informed decisions will be made based on fundamental and technical indicators. The fear and greed index of the crypto market will float above 60 as the global population starts to invest money. Amid such conditions, the signal to buy ONDO will shine bright as the rally hits new highs. In 2040, ONDO Finance price prediction estimates a new all-time high at $121.24. As ONDO continues the bull run, the speculative nature of the market will pump the volatility. Hence, the lowest price will likely be at $53.04, resulting in an average price of $87.14. Month Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) January 53.04 60.12 94.25 February 55.11 62.14 96.30 March 57.25 65.30 99.85 April 58.50 67.14 101.20 May 59.40 68.25 103.45 June 61.25 70.10 105.60 July 62.50 72.30 108.25 August 63.30 73.20 110.50 September 65.10 75.14 113.20 October 68.25 80.12 115.40 November 70.40 83.25 118.14 December 75.14 87.14 121.24 ONDO Price Prediction: Long-Term View for 2050 Despite the declining price price stability, the higher highs formation in the ONDO price will continue till 2050. By this time, the ONDO DAO will become one of the key players in the RWAs sector, dominating a large chunk of volume locked. Further, with valuations similar to the current traditional finance landscape. Amid such blue ocean conditions, the ONDO price will reach a height of $268.22 with a potential low of $120.44. Thus, the average price will be $194.33. Month Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) January 120.44 135.20 180.15 February 125.50 140.14 185.30 March 130.12 145.20 190.25 April 135.40 150.20 195.80 May 140.14 155.10 200.50 June 145.60 160.30 205.25 July 150.25 165.20 210.50 August 155.14 179.14 215.30 September 160.44 175.25 220.14 October 165.14 180.12 230.50 November 170.30 190.14 240.40 December 180.50 194.33 268.22 Technical Analysis of Ondo Finance In the daily price chart, ONDO Finance’s technical analysis showcases a falling wedge breakdown rally. It marks a pullback in the recovering rally. The recovery rally started from $0.5807 and peaked at $1.12. This marked a massive recovery of nearly 95%. Photo: TradingView However, the massive overhead supply led to two converging trendlines, constricting the ONDO price trajectory and resulting in a bearish turnaround. The ONDO coin price is now down to $0.9806. This marks an intraday pullback of 3.06%, followed by the 5.03% crash last night. Due to the prevailing bullish trend, the exponential moving average lines have maintained a positive alignment. Currently, the 20-day exponential moving average line provides dynamic support to the intraday pullback. With two consecutive bearish candles, the breakdown rally has undermined the last week’s recovery. The ONDO price is now below the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $1.02. Altcoin is currently on a potential retest of the 50% Fibonacci level breakout that coincided with a long-coming resistance zone. Hence, the ongoing pullback will likely consolidate near the retest as the technical indicator MACD prepares for a negative crossover. However, with the broader market recovery and the improving market sentiments, the post-retest reversal will likely recreate a new all-time high for ONDO in December. Supporting the upside chances, the relative strength index sustains above the halfway line. Estimating a similar bull run as early November, Ondo Finance’s price is likely to reach the $1.60 mark for a new all-time high. Conclusion Based on ONDO price prediction, the roadmap of the coming years are reflecting a blue ocean phase. With key driving factors such as the demand surge for tokenization of RWAs, the unique offerings over Flux Finance to hedge against the inflation, the crypto adoption, etc., ONDO Finance will become a leading player. With price projections estimating a cross beyond $30 by 2030, the short-term prediction projects $4.77 in 2025. Hence, the ONDO Finance price prediction gives a Buy signal for long term and in the ongoing bull market. This is not an investment advice.

  "title": "Australia Targets Crypto ATMs Over Money Laundering Risks",
  "content": " Please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice. The content on this page is for information purposes only. In a move to counter money laundering risks, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has announced plans to focus on crypto ATMs and their operators in 2025. The centre is increasing scrutiny of these machines due to concerns about their potential use in financial crimes. Australia Tightens Regulations on Crypto ATMs In a statement on December 6, AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas highlighted the vulnerability of crypto ATMs, noting they provide “attractive avenues for criminals looking to launder money, as they are widely accessible and make near-instant and irreversible transfers.” #Australia to crack down on crypto ATM providers, citing money laundering risk Australia’s national financial intelligence agency has flagged crypto as a priority for the year ahead and is creating a new task force to crack down on crypto ATM providers who may be flouting… pic.twitter.com/zRUaIYtUY2 — thewallstreetbull💸 (@thewallstbulloz) December 6, 2024 AUSTRAC’s new task force will enforce strict standards for crypto ATM operators. Operators must adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, including registering with AUSTRAC, conducting Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, monitoring transactions, and reporting suspicious activities. They must also report transactions exceeding $6,500 (10,000 AUD). Operators who fail to comply with these standards could face severe consequences. As per AUSTRAC, penalties for money laundering include fines up to $102,072 (158,400 AUD) or prison terms of up to 12 years. For offenses involving amounts exceeding $644,400 (1 million AUD), penalties increase to fines of $214,585 (333,000 AUD) and up to 25 years in jail. Despite already having 1,302 Bitcoin ATMs, the third-largest count globally after the U.S. and Canada, Australia has historically lagged in crypto ATM adoption. A surge in installations occurred in late 2022, with the country surpassing Asia in April 2023. Leading providers include Coinflip (680 ATMs), Localcoin (465), and Cryptolink (75). Rising Concerns About Crypto Crime The rapid rise in crypto ATM installations has coincided with concerns over their misuse. AUSTRAC reported that while 400 digital currency exchanges are registered in Australia, only a fraction operate crypto ATMs. According to Coin ATM Radar, the U.S. dominates the crypto ATM market, housing over 81% of global installations, while Canada ranks second with 3,022 machines. As crypto ATMs expand their presence in Australia, regulators are determined to balance innovation with security. This move aligns with AUSTRAC’s ongoing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Thomas stated, “As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation, which is why this task force will work to eliminate non-compliant high-risk operations.” The push for stricter regulations on crypto ATMs aligns with broader concerns about the lack of clear laws in Australia’s cryptocurrency market. According to a recent survey by Swyftx, many Australian investors are hesitant to participate in the crypto space due to the absence of strong regulations, with nearly one-third stating they would consider investing if clearer rules were introduced.

  "title": "Forex Today : US Dollar consolidates losses as attention turns to Nonfarm Payrolls data",
  "content": " Here is what you need to know on Friday, December 6: The US Dollar (USD) holds its ground early Friday after weakening against its major rivals on Thursday. Investors await November jobs report, which will include Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), Unemployment Rate and wage inflation figures. The US economic calendar will also feature the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index. Finally, several Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will deliver speeches on the last day before the blackout period starts. US Dollar PRICE This week The table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the weakest against the Swiss Franc. USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.00% -0.09% 0.03% 0.32% 1.31% 1.07% -0.18% EUR -0.00% -0.13% 0.03% 0.33% 1.40% 1.07% -0.16% GBP 0.09% 0.13% 0.13% 0.46% 1.54% 1.20% -0.06% JPY -0.03% -0.03% -0.13% 0.30% 1.32% 1.07% -0.26% CAD -0.32% -0.33% -0.46% -0.30% 1.14% 0.75% -0.51% AUD -1.31% -1.40% -1.54% -1.32% -1.14% -0.33% -1.57% NZD -1.07% -1.07% -1.20% -1.07% -0.75% 0.33% -1.22% CHF 0.18% 0.16% 0.06% 0.26% 0.51% 1.57% 1.22% The heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote). The USD Index came under bearish pressure and lost more than 0.5% on Thursday. In the European morning, the index stays in a consolidation phase below 106.00. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield fluctuates below 4.2% and US stock index futures trade mixed. Following the 12,000 increase recorded in October, NFP is forecast to rise by 200,000 in November. After climbing to a new record high above $100,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin reversed its direction and close the day in negative territory. Early Friday, BTC/USD trades at around $98,000. EUR/USD benefited from the broad-based USD weakness on Thursday and came within a touching distance of 1.0600. The pair edges slightly lower in the European morning on Friday but holds comfortably above 1.0550. Eurostat will publish revisions to third quarter Gross Domestic Product data. GBP/USD gathered bullish momentum and climbed to its highest level in three weeks above 1.2770 on Thursday. The pair trades marginally lower on the day slightly below 1.2750 to begin the European session. After rising for three consecutive days, USD/CAD reversed its direction and fell more than 0.3% on Thursday. The pair holds steady above 1.4000 early Friday. Statistics Canada will publish labor market data for November later in the day. USD/JPY edges lower and trades below 150.00 after posting small losses on Thursday. The data from Japan showed on Friday that Overall Household Spending declined by 1.3% on a yearly basis in October. This reading came in better than the market expectation for a decrease of 2.6%. Gold failed to capitalize on the selling pressure surrounding the USD and ended the day in the red on Thursday. After falling to its weakest level in over a week below $2,620 in the Asian session, XAU/USD gained traction and was last seen trading near $2,640. Nonfarm Payrolls FAQs Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) are part of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly jobs report. The Nonfarm Payrolls component specifically measures the change in the number of people employed in the US during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. The Nonfarm Payrolls figure can influence the decisions of the Federal Reserve by providing a measure of how successfully the Fed is meeting its mandate of fostering full employment and 2% inflation. A relatively high NFP figure means more people are in employment, earning more money and therefore probably spending more. A relatively low Nonfarm Payrolls’ result, on the either hand, could mean people are struggling to find work. The Fed will typically raise interest rates to combat high inflation triggered by low unemployment, and lower them to stimulate a stagnant labor market. Nonfarm Payrolls generally have a positive correlation with the US Dollar. This means when payrolls’ figures come out higher-than-expected the USD tends to rally and vice versa when they are lower. NFPs influence the US Dollar by virtue of their impact on inflation, monetary policy expectations and interest rates. A higher NFP usually means the Federal Reserve will be more tight in its monetary policy, supporting the USD. Nonfarm Payrolls are generally negatively-correlated with the price of Gold. This means a higher-than-expected payrolls’ figure will have a depressing effect on the Gold price and vice versa. Higher NFP generally has a positive effect on the value of the USD, and like most major commodities Gold is priced in US Dollars. If the USD gains in value, therefore, it requires less Dollars to buy an ounce of Gold. Also, higher interest rates (typically helped higher NFPs) also lessen the attractiveness of Gold as an investment compared to staying in cash, where the money will at least earn interest. Nonfarm Payrolls is only one component within a bigger jobs report and it can be overshadowed by the other components. At times, when NFP come out higher-than-forecast, but the Average Weekly Earnings is lower than expected, the market has ignored the potentially inflationary effect of the headline result and interpreted the fall in earnings as deflationary. The Participation Rate and the Average Weekly Hours components can also influence the market reaction, but only in seldom events like the “Great Resignation” or the Global Financial Crisis.

  "content": "Bitcoin reached $100,000 but declined amid profit-taking and volatility. Trump's actions remain the main driver but keep an eye on other factors. Key resistances at $99,000 and $105,000 should hold key to future movements. Discover the top stocks poised to benefit amid stock market's surge using InvestingPro's powerful tools - now up to 55% off amid the Extended Cyber Monday offer! After reaching the eagerly awaited $100,000 milestone this week, declined due to profit-taking and a risk-averse outlook ahead of today's anticipated report. Beyond the technical factors driving the cryptocurrency higher, Trump's decision to appoint Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, to lead the SEC supports a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin. In contrast, Jerome Powell's statement that Bitcoin should not compete with the US dollar is expected to have a more limited impact.Bitcoin's Rapid Price Movements Raise ConcernsWhile these developments drove Bitcoin to a new record high yesterday, sellers took control of the market later in the day. The pullback that began during the US session transitioned into a recovery as Asian trading commenced, reminiscent of earlier days in the cryptocurrency market. This 10% decline quickly wiped out accumulated long positions, with data showing around $300 million in long positions and $400 million in futures liquidated within minutes. The latest outlook suggests Bitcoin will face challenges around the $100,000 mark. A significant portion of the sell-off seems driven by accumulation in crypto futures, but market disturbances also contributed during the week. One such disturbance arose from Mt. Gox resuming BTC transfers, which caused fluctuations during the summer. As Bitcoin reached all-time highs, concerns grew that transfers exceeding $2 billion might lead to sales. Additionally, Meitu, often referred to as China's MicroStrategy, decided to liquidate its crypto assets, selling over 900 BTC. This move highlights institutions turning toward profit-taking. Interest in Bitcoin has surged in Asia recently. With accelerating fund flows into the crypto market, consolidation within the cryptocurrency sector may continue in the coming days. The recent downturn threatens to negatively impact the upward trend, despite appearing as an adjustment in futures positions.Will the Trump Rally Continue?Another Bitcoin-related development involves the debate over creating a Bitcoin reserve in the US, with some deeming it unnecessary. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers dismissed the proposal as \"crazy.\" Trump's Bitcoin reserve project excited crypto investors, though its realization seems unlikely. Investors, however, expect the US to avoid selling its Bitcoin holdings during Trump's tenure. This would exert considerable pressure on Bitcoin, especially at current price levels. Trump's presidential victory positively influenced Bitcoin throughout November, but by month's end, this effect seemed complete. In December, a slower news cycle might lead to sideways Bitcoin movement, with investors holding on for new developments. With the market focusing on the US, the Fed's anticipated 25 basis point rate cut this month may help maintain current levels. However, volatility could rise once Trump assumes office in January. It's crucial to prepare for unexpected developments. Monitoring Bitcoin's short-term support and resistance levels is essential.Technical Outlook for BitcoinThe Bitcoin chart shows sideways movement since November 22. Yesterday's sudden price movements can be disregarded as they lack support from daily closes, although they align with Fibonacci levels. We continue observing Bitcoin's upward trend that began in September. During this period, the $92,400 level served as a crucial resistance with a Fib 2.618 value and later became support. Subsequently, the $99,000 level appeared as intermediate resistance. The initial move beyond this resistance extended to the Fib 3.618 value at $104,997. Currently, the $99,000 mark remains the nearest resistance for Bitcoin. Daily closes above this point will prompt close monitoring of the $105,000 level for potential price breakout. In technical terms, the horizontal trend in the short term has reduced the energy of the Stochastic RSI, potentially paving the way for new advances above $100,000 in the coming days. The volume of these purchases will determine the trend's sustainability. However, recent rapid price movements suggest that surpassing $105,000 this month is unlikely. A fresh wave of positive news could quickly alter this perspective. On the downside, we can track the average level of $95,500 as intermediate support. Daily closes below this threshold will open the door for pullbacks toward stronger support at $92,400. From a broader perspective using the weekly chart, Bitcoin maintains its long-term upward trend, with the $105,000 region serving as a critical limit. If the current oscillation since 2023 persists, attempts to reach $105,000 in the short term may encounter selling pressure, potentially pushing Bitcoin into a price cycle that could extend toward $85,000. In summary, Bitcoin's short-term limits appear to be within the $92,400 to $105,000 range. As market volatility increases, these levels will likely be tested. Clear daily breaks of these support and resistance lines will play a crucial role in determining the new direction. *** Subscribe now to InvestingPro to take advantage of the market's top AI-powered stock-picker at a fraction of the cost.

  "title": "Stock market today : World stocks are mixed ahead of a key US jobs report",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. “This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Samara Asset Group p.l.c. (Samara)Malta, 12.06.2024 Samara Asset Group’s Net Asset Value per Share reaches €2.69 as Bitcoin Crosses $100,000 for the First Time Malta, Dec. 6, 2024. Samara Asset Group’s (ISIN: MT0001770107; Ticker: SRAG:GR) estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) per share reaches €2.69, reflective of an estimated NAV of €246 million, as Bitcoin reaches yet another new all-time high, crossing the mythical $100,000 for the very first time. The spike in NAV was further compounded by the ongoing surge of Northern Data’s share price, one of Samara’s core portfolio companies, which closed yesterday at €43 per share. The surge in the Bitcoin price has been driven by multiple macro factors, most prominently by a positive investor outlook on the future of crypto in the United States after the re-election of President Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to build a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the United States as well as to turn the U.S., which has historically been an anti-crypto jurisdiction, into a pro-crypto hub for innovation in the sector. The United States does not stand alone in driving the nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, however. The Russian government recently decreed Bitcoin to be legal property in Russia, stating correctly that nobody can ever ban Bitcoin. Russia’s decree came shortly after China announced it would become legal to hold and use Bitcoin in the country. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that many more nation-states, as well as individual States within the U.S., will follow the United States’ lead and build their own strategic reserves as the global race to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible continues to heat up. While Samara can’t compete with many nation-states, it ranks globally among the top 25 largest publicly listed owners of Bitcoin. As of this writing, Samara currently holds approximately 540 Bitcoin. Samara’s increase in NAV comes on the heels of a successful issuance of a Nordic Bond (Bond ISIN: NO0013364398), which saw the firm raise €20 million to broaden its portfolio of venture and alternative asset funds as well as acquire more Bitcoin. The successful placement of the bond marks the very first time in history a European firm has taken a page out of the “MicroStrategy / Michael Saylor Playbook”, issuing a bond with the intent to acquire Bitcoin. With the bond proceeds, Samara successfully acquired roughly 76 additional Bitcoin, which has already netted the firm an unrealized gain of €1.1 million since their purchase. Additionally, the firm has also committed €10.8M to new venture and alternative fund investments with bond proceeds. As of writing, Samara is currently invested as a Limited Partner (LP) in 21 venture and alternative asset funds, diversified across various sectors ranging from biotech and longevity to fintech, AI and blockchain. The bulk of these funds are posted as collateral in an SPV for the Nordic Bond with a gross value of €150 million, reflective of a severe over-collateralization of the Bond with a 13.3% LTV. “We believe this is just the very beginning of the bull market, not just for Bitcoin, but for the global economy as a whole,” said Patrick Lowry, Samara CEO. “We are highly encouraged by market signals we are seeing in crypto and in traditional markets. With our Bitcoin and venture fund investments, Samara is uniquely positioned to capitalize and profit substantially from our investments.” Christian Angermayer, member of Samara’s Advisory Committee, said “Bitcoin Game Theory is in full swing, and more and more nation states and corporates will adopt Bitcoin as their primary strategic reserve asset, just like Samara has. Couple this with an expectation of de-regulation of various sectors, most notably biotech in the United States, and I believe we have some great years ahead.” About Samara Asset Group p.l.c.

  "title": "Bitcoin soars past $100 , 000 in latest rally amid hopes of deregulation | NewsRadio 740 KTRH",
  "content": "KTRH Local Houston and Texas NewsBitcoin has seen its share of roller coaster rides, going up and down basically since its anonymous inception in 2009. It has seen massive crashes in 2018 and again in 2022 amid various market circumstances. But it has been on the rise the las year and a half and has even hit new highs as of a few days ago. The price of the cryptocurrency surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time ever this week, peaking around $103,000. As of the time of this article, it has dipped back to $97,000, but it is still sitting at heights it has not seen, breaking barriers no one really thought it could. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said before that Bitcoin is not a threat to the US Dollar but may give gold a run for its money. The recent surge certainly opens up the argument. So, the question has to be asked: will Bitcoin ever become widely used? Money and Business Expert Derrick Kinney says this recent surge has been because of the Donald Trump election win, giving hope for a new era of deregulation. \"We have seen crypto has a place, and have seen wider adoption institutionally with companies,\" he says. \"We will also probably see a wider acceptance of other financial options...and much less regulation, which tends to be good for the stock market.\" The Biden Administration has been placing staunch regulations on all types of businesses, including on Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is no stranger to that, having had regulations slapped on them starting in 2012. Trump has made it a platform of his to begin reversing the strict regulations when he arrives in office, which again, is bringing hope, especially back to heavily regulated businesses. But, while Trump may be good for the crypto game, there is a slight hitch in the giddy up. \"What Trump has done for crypto...will this have the same positive effect when tariffs kick in on various products,\" he says. \"Some analysts are nervous of the impacts...while people may make gain in crypto, they may then lose it paying for products.\" As mentioned, Fed Chair Powell has said that Bitcoin may be like the new gold. People tend to stock up on metals during hard times in the economy, as a 'rainy day fund' of sorts. But gold you can hold in your hand and physically see it. Bitcoin is just online encrypted currency, with no physical presence. However, that is what makes it even more appealing. \"Crypto you cannot feel or touch it, but it is not part of the US Dollar system,\" he says. The recent surge may have you thinking about investing money into the crypto game. But Kinney adds that you should only spend money you can afford to lose. Because as we know all too well with Bitcoin, it could plummet, and you could lose it. Bitcoin has risen 42 percent since Election night alone, and over 133 percent in 2024.

  "title": "Bitcoin ends brief fling with $100 , 000 as Trump announces crypto  czar  ",
  "content": " Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen sharply from the fresh all-time high achieved by the world’s largest cryptocurrency on Thursday. Bitcoin topped out at $104,000 late on Thursday evening before crashing more than 13% lower in the space of five hours. After bottoming out at $90,500, the BTC/USD pair has since settled at around $98,300, where it was trading on the spot markets at the time of writing. President-elect Donald Trump has fuelled the surge in bitcoin’s price. His campaign promises included making the US a crypto hub and building a bitcoin reserve. On Thursday, Trump announced the appointment of former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as his ‘White House A.I. & Crypto Czar’. An ardent Trump supporter who reportedly raised millions for the president-elect’s campaign, Sacks “will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness”, Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump added: “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S. David will also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology…” Trump has also named Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair when current chair Gary Gensler departs in January. Atkins is seen as more sympathetic to crypto than Gensler, who has led numerous high-profile litigations against prominent crypto firms including XRP token developer Ripple Labs during his stint. Bitcoin is currently up 132% year to date. Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 – Source: tradingview.com "

When FOX Business host Stuart Varney asked the Canadian politician whether she knew if she was \"killing the planet\" by exporting oil, she replied: \"We have 200 billion barrels of oil in reserve that's recoverable.\"\"We've got 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. And we also have pore space that is probably the best in the world, next only to Russia,\" she added. \"I think we're a better trading partner and friend than Russia. And so we have a plan to take carbon dioxide, capture it and bury it, carbon capture utilization and storage. We have already done this at scale. We've already safely sequestered 14 million tons of CO2. We intend to do more of that, and I think that the other part of it is that we want to have our lower emissions fuel being exported internationally so that we can reduce the global emissions picture.\" BITCOIN HITS $100,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERO'Leary claimed Smith's comments about the amount of oil reserves caught a \"ton\" of attention.

And that’s what we need for Bitcoin mining, we need for A.I. data centers,\" O’Leary said on Thursday. \"She's coming out blasting there… that was pretty interesting.\" Mining is a process used by Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies to generate new coins and verify new transactions, according to Coinbase. It is a high-energy intensive, expensive process that may be countered by utilizing natural gas to power Bitcoin-mining data centers. Smith also mentioned that she has plans to head to Washington D.C. for Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in January. When asked whether she's a \"big Trump fan,\" she replied: \"I am a fan of our biggest trading partner, so [a] $188 billion relationship. We had a great relationship with the previous administration. I know we will have a great relationship with the new administration.\" Varney also invited her to come back to the show in New York City.\"You might come and meet her,\" Varney suggested to O'Leary. \"She's my new special friend if she's got that much energy,\" the \"Shark Tank\" star replied. \"And she's going to be getting a lot of phone calls from other people just like me – I can guarantee you that.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE"

  "title": "Nonfarm payrolls , Bitcoin , cash inflows - what moving markets By Investing . com",
  "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street is seen treading water Friday ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly US jobs report for clues of future Federal Reserve policy. Bitcoin slips back below $100,000, and its dominance could be threatened, while investors turn towards cash. 1. Payrolls loom large All eyes Friday will be on the US payrolls data release, due later in the session, for fresh insights into how the economy is faring ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. Economists are expecting the economy to have added 202,000 in November, a sharp rebound from the meager 12,000 jobs added in October after disruptions from strikes and hurricanes resulted in jobs growth being severely constrained. That was the smallest gain since December 2020. Such a rebound is unlikely to alter market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again later this month, especially as US growth slowed in November and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week. But a repeat of September’s blowout jobs report could disrupt expectations for future Fed rate cuts. Financial markets currently see a roughly 70% chance of a 25 basis points rate cut at the US central bank's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, CME's FedWatch tool showed. 2. Futures steady ahead of nonfarm payrolls US stock futures were little changed Friday, with investors wary of committing ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly official jobs report. By 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT), the contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, climbed 3 points, or 0.1%, and rose by 23 points, or 0.1%. The main benchmarks retreated from the previous session’s record levels Thursday, with the leading the way, falling almost 250 points, or 0.6%. Week to date, the broad-based is up 0.7%, the tech-heavy has gained 2.5%, while the DJIA is down marginally. The day’s key focus will be on the nonfarm payrolls release, with investors looking for clues to the health of the US labor market after Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated earlier in the week that the largest economy in the world was strong enough for the central bank to move carefully on rate cuts. On the corporate side, the likes of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:), Gitlab (NASDAQ:) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:) will be in the spotlight after the companies all released well received results after the close on Thursday. 3. Bitcoin dominance to fade? slipped lower Friday, retreating after the breach of the $100,000 mark earlier in the week, and the world’s most popular cryptocurrency dominance could fade. At 03:50 ET, Bitcoin traded 4.3% lower to $98,550.0, still over 1% higher this week. The digital currency surged to record highs this week on optimism over friendlier regulations under Donald Trump, with the most recent The latest point of support coming from Trump nominating pro-crypto lawyer Paul Atkins as the next Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Market capitalization of the whole crypto sector hit a record high of $3.7 trillion on Thursday, but interestingly Bitcoin’s relative share of market capitalization fell to 53.9% by Friday, data from Coinmarketcap showed, after hitting a three-year high, at around 59%, in late November. Analysts at Citi warned that regulatory clarity may erode the coin’s dominance in crypto markets, as it could broaden the asset class’s appeal, fostering strength in coins and tokens beyond Bitcoin. “Over the long-term, we think a network’s utility or value will be related to usage, as well as macro correlations and production costs. A new regulatory regime may unlock further or broader use cases for blockchain assets,” Citi analysts wrote, in a note. 4. Investors turn to cash Uncertainty over whether the recent gains on Wall Street, that have resulted in record closing levels, can continue has seen investors turn to cash this week. A report from Bank of America, published earlier Friday, indicated that investors ploughed $136.4 billion into cash in the week to Wednesday, the biggest weekly inflow since March 2023, when markets were rattled by a regional banking crisis. Buying of U.S. equities continued for the ninth consecutive week, although at a reduced level with inflows of just $8.2 billion of stocks, while investors also bought $4.9 billion of bonds. Crypto got a $3 billion injection, and clocked its largest four-week inflow ever, at $11 billion. 5. Brent on course for weekly loss Oil prices slipped lower Friday, with the global benchmark on course for substantial weekly losses on concerns of slowing demand after OPEC+ extended its current run of supply cuts until well into 2025. By 03:50 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $68.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $71.77 a barrel. For the week, Brent was on track to drop around 1.5%, while WTI hung on to marginal gains. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, delayed the start of its oil output increases by three months until April and extended the full unwinding of cuts by a year until the end of 2026. The group of top producers originally planned to start unwinding cuts from October, but a slowdown in global demand - especially in China - has forced it to postpone the plan several times. The cartel has also repeatedly cut its demand growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025. "

This historic achievement was reported by The Kobeissi Letter on... \"validation of its role as the ultimate store of value,\" close Bitcoin View More > Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic cash system that uses peer-to-peer networking, digital signatures and cryptographic proof so as to enable users to conduct irreversible transactions without relying on trust. Nodes broadcast transactions to the network, which records them in a public history, called the blockchain, after validating them with a proof-of-work system. Users make transactions with bitcoins, an alternative, digital currency that the network issues according to predetermined rules.

  "content": "President-elect Donald Trump today said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,” another step towards overhauling U.S. policy. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.,” Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether “czar” was an official title. The crypto czar and other officials in Trump’s incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump’s tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules. Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who has invested in companies such as Airbnb and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, called the choice of Sacks a “strong move” in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X, “congrats to czar @DavidSacks!” “Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails,” Steve Jang, founder of Kindred Ventures, told Reuters.

He predicted that Sacks will prioritize regulating how AI is used in certain critical applications instead of focusing on regulating the development of the AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of contention for Silicon Valley investors who vehemently opposed California’s unsuccessful SB 1047 bill, which sought to regulate AI model development. Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry. Trump – who once labeled crypto a scam – embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. “David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think,” Dibb said. Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002. Sacks is considered a member of the “PayPal Mafia” of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency. Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users. He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet. “It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money,” he said. Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology.

  "content": " Currency markets remain tense as the U.S. jobs report and global political instability dominate headlines. Credit: Wikimedia Commons The currency markets remained tense on Friday as traders awaited the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for November while grappling with political upheavals across Europe and Asia. In a week marked by uncertainty, the report is seen as critical for gauging the direction of Federal Reserve policy. Economic Data Drives Market Uncertainty The U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due later on Friday, is expected to show an increase of 200,000 jobs for November, according to a Reuters survey. This follows a dramatic slowdown in October, where job growth hit its lowest level since December 2020. Market analysts are closely monitoring the data to assess the likelihood of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said, “Indicators this week, including private payrolls and jobless claims, suggest payrolls could meet expectations. An on-target report would likely confirm a December interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.” Currently, markets estimate a 72% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting, up from 66.5% a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. However, a stronger-than-expected jobs report could shift the focus to next week’s U.S. inflation data, which may alter the Fed’s trajectory. Political Turmoil Adds to Market Tensions The euro struggled against the dollar on Friday, trading at $1.0582 after rebounding from a three-week low earlier in the week. French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that he would appoint a new prime minister to replace Michel Barnier, following Barnier's government ousting, added political uncertainty in Europe. Despite the turmoil, the European Central Bank is unlikely to respond directly to political instability when it meets next week. Analysts anticipate the ECB will trim interest rates by 25 basis points on December 12 as it grapples with sluggish economic growth. Meanwhile, in South Korea, the dollar spiked against the won after local media reported rumors of another martial law declaration. The won fell 0.42% to 1419.27 per dollar as political instability kept Korean markets on edge. Authorities have pledged \"unlimited liquidity\" to stabilize financial conditions. In China, the yuan traded flat at 7.2632 against the dollar, extending its 10th consecutive weekly loss amid concerns over U.S. tariffs and Beijing's economic policies. President-elect Donald Trump's recent tariff threats have heightened strains on the Chinese economy, prompting speculation about whether Beijing will ease its grip on the currency to boost exports. Cryptocurrencies and Other Markets Bitcoin retreated from its record high of $103,649, briefly sliding to $98,170, reflecting a volatile week for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the dollar gained 0.32% against the yen, trading at 150.55, as speculation swirled over a potential December rate hike by the Bank of Japan. Elsewhere, the Australian and New Zealand dollars faced declines, with the Australian dollar trading at $0.64285, down 0.37%, and the New Zealand dollar at $0.5854, down 0.52%. Social Media Reactions The week’s developments sparked lively discussions online: @ForexGuru: “All eyes on the U.S. payrolls report. The Fed’s December decision hinges on this data!” @MarketObserverEU: “Political instability in France and South Korea is a wildcard for global markets this week.” @CryptoTracker: “Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride continues! Will it break $100K again, or was this the peak?” @TradeInsights: “Trump’s tariffs could shake up the yuan even more. Watching closely for Beijing’s next move.” @ECBWatchdog: “A December rate cut from the ECB feels inevitable, but will it be enough for Europe?” @StockSignals: “Investors are spooked by uncertainty. Safe-haven assets are looking more attractive by the day.” "

France’s CAC 40 saw an early trading increase of 0.4% to 7,357.30 after French President Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to remain in office until the end of his term and appoint a new prime minister within days. This follows the approval of a no-confidence motion by far-right and left-wing lawmakers over budget disputes, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet. Germany’s DAX remained relatively unchanged at 20,357.73, while Britain’s FTSE 100 saw a slight decrease of 0.1% to 8,344.48. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. The key event for markets this week will be Friday’s jobs report from the US government, revealing the number of hires and layoffs last month. A report on Thursday indicated that the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits increased last week but remains at historically healthy levels. In Asian trading, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell by 0.8% to 39,091.17. The US dollar rose to 150.35 Japanese yen from 150.10 yen. Chinese stocks rallied with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong adding 1.6% to 19,865.85 and the Shanghai Composite index surging 1.1% to 3,404.08. Markets are keeping a close eye on the outcome of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. Analysts have suggested that policymakers may err on the side of caution as they prepare for President-elect Donald Trump's potential actions on tariffs and trade. South Korea’s Kospi fell by 0.6% to 2,428.16. On Friday, the leader of South Korea’s ruling party expressed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked it earlier this week. Yoon is now facing calls to resign and be investigated, with impeachment a possibility. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, and thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s largest labour groups, began partial strikes on Thursday in protest against Yoon. The union has stated that its members will commence indefinite strikes from Wednesday if Yoon does not step down by then. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.6% to 8,420.90. Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 on Thursday before retreating after exceeding $100,000 for the first time following President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of financier Paul Atkins, who is viewed as a crypto advocate, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin was trading at 98,670.46 early on Friday. On Thursday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, but it is still on track to close out one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before. Strong consumer spending has kept the US economy afloat, staving off a recession that seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to tackle inflation. However, shoppers are now grappling with persistently high prices and a decelerating job market. There is widespread anticipation that the Fed will once again reduce its primary interest rate in its pre-Christmas meeting. The Fed started lowering its main interest rate from a 20-year peak in September, aiming to provide additional support for the job market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slightly decreased to 4.17% from 4.18% late Wednesday. On Friday, benchmark US crude dropped 22 cents to $68.08 a barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, remained steady at $72.09 a barrel. The euro marginally fell to $1.0577 from $1.0589."

I feel that’s what the market is responding to this morning,” said Graham Priest, investment advisor at BlueShore Financial.Bets for a hefty half-point rate cut stand at 80%, up from 49% seen earlier in the day.The BoC this year has already reduced its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points in a bid to boost economic growth.“We’ve had a very strong performance this year and there does seem to be the expectation that it will continue into 2025,” Priest added. TSX is up 23% for the year.Among sectors, information technology led the gains, rising 2.1%, boosted by a 6.1% jump in e-commerce firm Shopify.The heavyweight financials sector rose 0.4%, buoyed by Laurentian Bank jumping 7.8% after exceeding quarterly profit estimates, and Bank of Montreal gaining 4.2% following an upgrade by CIBC.In contrast, the energy sector fell 2% after oil prices slipped over 1%.Wall Street’s main indexes edged higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching intraday record highs as traders increased bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut this month following robust November payrolls data.U.S. job growth surged in November after being severely constrained by hurricanes and strikes, but this is unlikely to signal a material shift in labor market conditions, which continue to ease steadily and would allow the Fed to cut interest rates again this month.“This jobs report came out right in the Goldilocks zone - not too hot so as to derail interest-rate cuts in December (or next year), but also not too cold, which could have spooked financial markets about the underlying health of the U.S. economy,” said Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst, ClearBridge Investments.Traders boosted bets the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates this month, now signaling a more than 90% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s upcoming Dec. 17-18 meeting, versus 67% before the release of the jobs report.Meanwhile, a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s U.S. consumer sentiment survey stood at 74 in December, compared with an estimate of 73, according to economists polled by Reuters.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49.46 points, or 0.11%, to 44,815.17, the S&P 500 gained 22.11 points, or 0.36%, to 6,097.33, and the Nasdaq Composite added 142.28 points, or 0.72%, to 19,843.00.Most megacap and growth stocks rose, with Tesla and Amazon up 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively, pulling the Consumer Discretionary sector up 1.3% to a record high.Lululemon Athletica also added 17.2% after the Canadian sportswear maker increased its full-year forecasts, betting on resilient demand for its athletic wear.Fed officials including San Francisco President Mary Daly are scheduled to make public appearances through the day, on the eve of a media blackout that kicks in on Saturday in the run-up to the central bank’s Dec. 17-18 policy meeting.U.S. stocks closed lower in the last session, with UnitedHealth down sharply and technology shares giving up some gains after a steady increase through the week.Despite Thursday’s pullback, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were on track for their third consecutive weekly gains, while the blue-chip Dow was set for minor losses.The three indexes have rallied this year as investors bought into heavyweight tech stocks, in a bid to cash in on the euphoria around artificial intelligence.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win in the Nov. 5 election has provided further tailwinds for stocks. Analysts expect his tax-cut policies and looser regulations to support corporate performance.Ulta Beauty advanced 12.1% after the cosmetics retailer raised its annual profit forecast, signaling a revival in demand for perfumes and makeup during the holiday shopping season.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and by a 1.97-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 37 new lows.Reuters"

What you need to know today U.S. markets take a breather The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55% and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.18% as traders await today's jobs report. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday. India's Nifty 50 slipped around 0.1% on the country's interest rate decision, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed roughly 1.3%. India's central bank keeps ratesThe Reserve Bank of India on Friday left interest rates unchanged at 6.5%, as economists in a Reuters poll had expected. The central bank is balancing India's high inflation and a slowing economy: year-on-year prices rose 6.21% in October, while the country's fiscal third-quarter gross domestic product grew by a surprisingly low 5.4% from a year ago. What to expect from U.S. jobs reportThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for November is coming out later today. After the shockingly low 12,000 jobs added in October — largely attributed to factors like disruptions from hurricanes and strikes — economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 214,000 jobs in November. The October number could also be revised higher. Crypto continues riding wavesOn Thursday, bitcoin smashed the $100,000 barrier — though it has since retreated from that level to around $98,100. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's announcement on Thursday that venture investor David Sacks will be the White House's \"A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" investor sentiment toward bitcoin might get another boost. [PRO] Top global picks for 2025Investment bank Macquarie is bullish on several Asian stocks for the next year. Those companies span sectors from automotive to defense and have a potential upside of at least 50%, according to the bank. Money Report The bottom line The U.S., in terms of its economy and financial markets, seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though major U.S. indexes fell yesterday, when viewed in the context of their performance this week, it looks like a slight pause after achieving a series of record closing levels. And U.S. stocks could continue notching fresh highs in the future, according to bank analysts. \"As far as the SPX goes, we believe the index will finish 2025 in the 6500 to 6700 range,\" Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a Wednesday note. Taking the higher end of Wren's estimate, that implies a 10% upside from Thursday's close. If that scenario plays out for the S&P 500, it would mark the third consecutive year of gains for the broad-based index. The S&P has already shot up 27.6% year to date, its second-highest annual increase in the 21st century, according to Deutsche Bank. The strength of the U.S. stock market is more striking when compared with its European counterpart. \"MAGA policy expectations, coupled with Goldilocks data, have revived animal spirits for US equities. In contrast, Europe remains on the back foot amid stagnant growth, tariff threats and political crisis in France,\" Barclays wrote on Wednesday. \"It is hard to see an end to US exceptionalism any time soon, which we think remains the playbook into 2025.\" The U.S. economy, likewise, isn't showing signs of flagging. The Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter to hit 3.3% on an annualized basis. That's a small uptick from its 3.2% estimate earlier this week, and higher than third-quarter growth of 2.8%. Employment is the engine that powers most aspects of the economy. November's jobs report, out later today, will give investors more insight into whether U.S. economic and financial growth can continue racing forward. — CNBC's Jesse Pound, Lisa Kailai Han and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.

  "content": "Investing.com -- Cash contributed the majority of money flows last week, while crypto funds attracted another jumbo inflow, Bank of America revealed Friday. Money market funds absorbed $136.4 billion in the week to December 4, marking the largest weekly inflow since March. Stocks attracted $8.2 billion, bonds $4.9 billion, and crypto $3 billion, while $400 million exited gold, according to a Bank of America note citing EPFR Global data. Most notably, crypto funds achieved their largest-ever four-week inflow of $11 billion, reflecting renewed investor appetite for digital assets following Donald Trump’s win in the recent US election. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at BofA, flagged signs of \"froth\" in crypto markets as Bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeded $2 trillion, making it the 11th largest economy globally. Similarly, concerns about equity valuations were highlighted, with the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio at 5.3, surpassing the peak seen in March 2000. Hartnett warned that the risk of an \"overshoot\" in the in Q1 2024 is “high,” citing potential moves toward 6,666 on the index as the US dollar breaks parity with the . On macro, the strategist said the Federal Reserve will likely ease rates at its meeting on Dec. 18 unless November US payrolls exceed 275,000 and Average Hourly Earnings (AHE) grow by more than 0.3%. Regionally, US equities posted their ninth consecutive week of inflows at $8.2 billion, while emerging markets saw inflows resume with $600 million. On the other hand, European equities experienced their tenth straight week of outflows at $5.1 billion, and Japanese equities recorded their third consecutive week of outflows at $600 million. In fixed income, investment-grade bonds extended their streak to 58 weeks of inflows, garnering $7.3 billion. High-yield bonds added $500 million, maintaining a 17-week streak of inflows. Treasury funds, however, resumed outflows, losing $4.4 billion, while emerging market debt and TIPS also saw outflows of $300 million each. Bank loans attracted $1.1 billion, marking their ninth straight week of inflows, and municipal bonds added $100 million, maintaining a 23-week streak."

  "content": "U.S. stocks could open in the red on Friday as investors exercise caution and take a break after pushing the Dow past 45,000 for the first time. Futures of all three major indices were marginally down on Friday, pointing to cautious sentiment on Wall Street. Investors remain tentative on equities ahead of the crucial payroll data that is set to be released later today. Also playing on investors' minds are Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's comments about the U.S. economy's strength. \"The labor market is better, and the downside risks appear to be less in the labor market. Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming [out] a little higher,\" Powell said during an interview at the New York Times' DealBook Summit on Wednesday. However, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows that expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December stand at 66.7%, up from 66% a week ago.

Cues From Last Session: U.S. stocks closed on a negative note on Thursday, with all three major indices registering declines. The Dow Jones closed below 45,000 after scaling the mark for the first time on Wednesday. Crude oil prices fell on Friday after OPEC+ announced its decision to delay an increase in its production output. Treasury yields edged up slightly ahead of the payrolls data release. On the economic data front, U.S. initial jobless claims increased to 224,000 in the week ending Nov. 30, compared to 213,000 in the previous week, and higher than market estimates of 215,000. The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $73.8 billion in October versus a revised $83.8 billion gap in the previous month and compared to market estimates of a $75 billion gap. Most sectors on the S&P 500 closed on a negative note, with industrials, materials, and healthcare stocks recording the biggest losses on Thursday. However, consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks bucked the overall market trend, closing the session higher.

He added that the S&P 500 hitting the 6,300 level by the end of the year is \"very doable.\" At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,062, down 4.43% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro data. On the other hand, Sonu Varghese, Vice President, Global Macro Strategist at Carson Group, flagged a Fed policy error as a \"big risk for 2025.\" Varghese's warning comes after Powell's comments about rate cuts earlier this week signaled that the Fed chair is willing to be patient, instead of rushing through with the cuts as earlier thought. He thinks that stubborn inflation could force the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to be more cautious with stepping on the rate cut pedal. Varghese anticipates that elevated inflation could result in no rate cuts for as long as the first half of 2025. \"Ultimately, if the Fed does pause for an extended period of time, that's going to be on the back of spurious, backward-looking inflation data, rather than what's happening in reality.\" \"Meanwhile, policy would implicitly be getting tighter, as policy rates stay elevated and underlying inflation remains muted. That's a big risk for cyclical sectors of the economy,\" he added. See Also: How To Trade Futures Upcoming Economic Data Friday's economic calendar consists of some crucial data releases.

  "title": "Bitcoin hitting a record $104 , 091 is nothing short of remarkable - London Business News",
  "content": " Christoph Hardt/Geisler-Fotopres / DPA Picture Alliance / Avalon Bitcoin’s ascent past the psychological $100,000 mark to a record $104,091 was nothing short of remarkable, but the levels didn’t hold and we saw sellers play out all through US trade, culminating in a liquidity vacuum on the roll to Asia with price collapsing 6k before retracing the falls. The surge was fueled by a confluence of robust capital inflows and bullish news, while the pullback underscored the risks of market-wide liquidations. Institutional players remain pivotal in driving this rally. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen four consecutive days of net inflows, with a jaw-dropping $676 million recorded in just a single day. Industry heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have been key contributors, reinforcing Bitcoin’s growing appeal to institutional investors. On the regulatory front, optimism surged following Trump’s announcement of Paul Atkins as the next SEC chairman. Atkins, seen as a crypto advocate compared to Gensler, has heightened expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory framework starting in 2025, injecting fresh enthusiasm into the market. Adding to the positive momentum, Russia’s increasing crypto adoption has been a game-changer. Putin’s recent legislation recognizing digital currencies as property and exempting mining and sales from VAT has set a progressive tone. His pointed remarks on reducing foreign exchange reserves while showing a keen interest in Bitcoin have further bolstered sentiment. Looking ahead, the focus is squarely on whether Bitcoin can reclaim $100,000 after this correction. I see the pullback as a healthy consolidation driven by short-term profit-taking. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which peaked at an extreme greed level of 84 yesterday, has eased to a more sustainable 72, indicating a much-needed reset. The long lower shadows on recent candlesticks also signal that bulls remain resilient, preparing for another push higher. The broader backdrop remains supportive. With strong performance in U.S. equities, solid economic data, and sustained institutional engagement, the case for further upside remains compelling. However, the road ahead isn’t without risks: Policy uncertainty: While Atkins’ nomination has sparked hope, Trump’s presidency doesn’t officially begin until January 2025. This transitional period may lead to profit-taking as institutions adopt a wait-and-see approach. Leverage risks: Open interest in Bitcoin futures has hit a record 626,100 BTC, according to Coinglass, underscoring the heavy reliance on leverage. While it has amplified gains, it also leaves the market vulnerable to sharp reversals if liquidation triggers emerge. Bitcoin’s volatility remains its hallmark. While the potential for growth is undeniable, navigating these risks will be crucial for traders and investors alike. Leave a Comment "

  "title": "Record Bitcoin Rally Results in $676 Million of Trader Liquidations",
  "content": " Key Takeaways Bitcoin and the crypto market’s record rally has resulted in traders expressing extreme greed, liquidating approximately $676.21 million in long and short positions as they exited the market over the past 24 hours. Out of these liquidations, long positions predicting prices to rise accounted for $372.79 million, while short positions expecting prices to drop saw $303.42 million in liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC) led the chart with $182.52 million in overall liquidations, with $134.82 million in short positions and $47.69 million in long positions. Ethereum (ETH) registered $92.1 million in liquidations, with $61.15 million in long and $31.01 million in short positions. Crypto exchanges OKX, Binance, and Bitget saw the largest liquidation transactions, totaling $582 million. The biggest individual liquidation transaction occurred on Bitget, which was $8.9 million worth of BTC/USD position. Bitcoin has been on a record-breaking run ever since Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the U.S. Presidential elections, registering an all-time high of $104,000 on December 5, 2024. However, CoinGlass data revealed that traders took full advantage of the massive breakout by liquidating over $650 million worth of cryptocurrencies. Traders Liquidate $676.21 Million In BTC, ETH, XRP, And SOL Amid Bull Run Over the past 24 hours, 208,238 traders liquidated approximately $676.21 million in various cryptocurrencies, with long positions accounting for most of these at $372.79 million, while short positions witnessed $303.42 million in overall liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC) led the chart with liquidations worth $182.52 million, with data showing that most of these exits were by traders who took a short position expecting the price of the flagship cryptocurrency to fall, valued at $134.82 million. Meanwhile, long positions in Bitcoin saw a loss of $47.69 million. Ethereum (ETH) traders came in second, facing losses of approximately $92.16 million. More than $61 million in short positions and $31.01 million in ETH long positions were liquidated. Whereas in the case of Ripple (XRP), there were more long traders ($39.41 million) liquidating than short traders ($16.49 million). Other popular large-cap altcoins, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL), saw losses of more than $100 million, while the rest of the market contributed to an additional $114 million in losses. Majority of Liquidations Were By Long Traders Who Profit From Rising Token Prices OKX, Binance, and Bybit exchanges were where the biggest liquidations took place. These platforms registered liquidations of $260 million, $163 million, and $159 million, respectively. The single-largest individual liquidation occurred on Bybit, which was a short BTC/USD position worth $8.9 million. Interestingly, 56% of the liquidations came from traders in long positions, who were betting on the prices to rise. Given the prevailing bullish sentiment and the sudden price drops of leading crypto tokens like XRP and Hedera (HBAR) in the last 24 hours, this outcome was not a surprise. The liquidations were largely driven by Bitcoin’s bullish performance over the past week. The apex crypto asset’s price peaked on December 4, when it crossed the psychological level of $100,000. Experts believe this triggered extreme greed among traders, who rushed to exit their positions and cash out the profits. Despite the increased liquidations, data shows that the trading volume of Bitcoin surged by 88.19% to hit $128.20 billion as investor interest in the digital currency continues to grow. Since crossing the coveted $100,000 mark, the price of BTC has remained fairly stable between $103,500 and $101,600. In the case of Ethereum, the coin has registered a 5.29% increase in its price to trade at a high of $3,930. The world’s second-largest crypto asset’s market volume is up 48.21% to $65.74 billion. However, XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw its price dip by 7.9% in the last 24 hours to $2.40, with market volume dropping by 26.90% to $26.48 billion.

His appointment of Sacks and Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission are seen as crypto-friendly moves, further driving up Bitcoin's value. But, it's Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who still faces a challenging confirmation process.Hegseth appeared on Capitol Hill this week to appeal to senators amid allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault, and controversial opinions about women's roles in the military.\"This process has been a very good one despite all the noise on the outside,\" Hegseth said to a crowd of reporters. \"As long as President Trump wants me in this fight, I'm going to be standing right here in this fight - fighting to bring the Pentagon back to what it needs to be.\"Some Senators have debated their involvement in the vetting and confirmation process.\"Who are we to say that we're a better vetter and picker of people than Donald Trump?\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville said. \"That's not our job to do that. That's the Democrats.\"Democrats have pushed back.\"The Constitution says that every one of us must advise and consent on every nominee made by the president,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. \"Individually, we take an oath not to a president, but to the Constitution. And I think that any senator who says I'm just going to vote in favor of whoever the president sends up because the president has vetted him enough is really violating their oath of office.\" "

  "content": " Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. GREENVALE, N.Y. — Not yet even in office, Donald Trump said Thursday he's already accomplished more than President Joe Biden did in his entire term, an outsized claim by the president-elect just a month out from the election. Trump, who has been largely ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club in recent weeks as he's worked to staff his new administration, made the comment as he ventured to New York's Long Island to be honored as part of Fox Nation’s annual Patriot Awards on Fox's streaming platform. “I think you have seen more happen in the last two weeks than you have in the last four years,” Trump told the crowd at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. “It was a tremendous day, a tremendous night,” he said, recalling his election victory in a 10-minute acceptance speech that sounded like a highlight reel of his campaign rally speeches. It came complete with a live performance of “God Bless the USA” by the singer Lee Greenwood, calls to “get the criminals out of our country” and an embrace of all-paper election ballots and mandatory voter ID. Trump also pointed to the conversations he's had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he threatened two of the country's top trading partners with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless they do more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows. “Justin came flying right in,” Trump said in reference to Trudeau's trip to Mar-a-Lago. That prompted some in the audience to chant “51!” — a nod to Trump apparently joking at his dinner with Trudeau that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state. The annual awards “honor and recognize America’s finest patriots, including military veterans, first responders and other inspirational everyday heroes,” according to Fox. The event was hosted by Fox host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend who stepped in after the president-elect nominated Pete Hegseth, the original host, as defense secretary. Among those recognized Thursday night were conservative actor and evangelist Kirk Cameron; Gen. Dick Cody, who used his own helicopter to deliver supplies to people after Hurricane Helene; and Jonathan Diller, the New York Police Department officer who was killed during a traffic stop in Queens. His widow, Stephanie, received a standing ovation and thanked Trump for his support. Others invoked Trump as well. The ceremony also honored Paws of War, an organization that provides service dogs to veterans and helps those serving overseas bring animals they meet in war zones to the U.S. The heartfelt moments were juxtaposed against the kind of boisterous and incendiary political fare that loyal watchers of Fox hosts like Hannity expect. The anchor used his introduction to take an election victory lap, boasting that Democrats “got their ass kicked.\" He played “YMCA” — the song Trump has long used to close out his rallies — and invited audience members to dance like the president-elect. And he offered a series of impressions, mimicking former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s enthusiasm and Biden appearing lost, complete with a backdrop of the rainforest where he spoke during a recent trip to the Amazon. Later, he donned an orange safety vest — a nod to the one Trump wore when he delivered a press conference from a garbage truck during the campaign after Biden suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump's award marks the culmination of Fox's reembrace of the president-elect, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the network in recent years. Fox paid $787 million in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims by Fox personalities who echoed Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him through mass voter fraud. For more than six months ending in spring 2023, Fox had what many considered a “soft ban” on Trump appearances, with its leaders looking to move on. But when it became clear that voters did not want to, Fox and its personalities were quick to embrace Trump again. Individual personalities have undergone their own journeys: Former Fox host Megyn Kelly drew Trump’s ire in a 2015 debate for her sharp question about his treatment of women; now she’s a popular podcast host and Trump supporter. The Dominion lawsuit uncovered emails in which former Fox host Tucker Carlson spoke disparagingly of Trump, including saying he “truly can’t wait” for Trump to become an ex-president. They’ve since made amends. Through it all, Trump has been quick to take to social media to criticize Fox for content he deems insufficiently loyal. On Thursday, he was more magnanimous. “You have incredible people at Fox,\" he said before quipping, “A couple I don’t like.\" Trump has begun to emerge more in public since spending most of his transition so far behind closed doors at his club in Palm Beach, Florida. This week, he made an unannounced appearance at a memorial service for three Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies who were killed in a car crash last month. This weekend, he will travel to Paris to join other world leaders and dignitaries for a ceremony to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by a fire five years ago. ___ AP Media Writer David Bauder contributed to this report.

  "title": "Long bond yields defused ahead of payrolls , France rallies",
  "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Somewhat counter to post-election narratives and many new year outlooks, long-dated U.S. Treasury yields continue to sink as the November payrolls report holds all the attention on Friday. The 30-year 'long bond' yield fell to 6-week lows of 4.31%, flattening the 2-30 year U.S. yield curve gap to just 16 basis points - its lowest since August. With the 2-10 year curve flat as a pancake near zero, bond market volatility gauges subsided to their lowest since September. Perhaps year-end effects are at play, with another steep rise in cash-like money market fund holdings to a record $6.77 trillion in the latest week also catching eyes even as stock indexes hold near record highs. But with economic and trade uncertainty high before Donald Trump's new administration takes office next month, and many Federal Reserve officials hesitant about another interest rate cut this year, the calming of the Treasury market is notable. More immediately, markets need to negotiate November's jobs report. Forecasters reckon the report will show payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs in November. But there remain nagging doubts about the labor market after October's surprisingly small 12,000 gain - the weakest since 2020 - and the unemployment rate is expected to tick up a tenth to 4.2%. While October's low jobs reading was distorted by storms and strikes, this week's U.S. economic updates have nodded to some emerging softness - most obviously in the ISM survey of the dominant service sector but also in creeping jobless claims, ebbing hiring rates and sub-forecast private payrolls. The U.S. economic surprise index compiled by Citi remains firmly in positive territory but at its lowest since October. Ahead of the jobs report, Fed futures remain uncertain about another rate cut this month and price just a 65% chance of a move. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday appeared to signal a slower pace of rate cuts ahead when he said the economy was stronger at this point than the Fed had expected in September. The dollar perked up a bit on Friday after the prior day's slide.FRENCH RALLY Thursday's currency shift owed as much to a rallying euro and French bonds and stocks as political tensions in Paris appeared to ease. French debt risk premiums versus benchmark German bunds fell after French President Emmanuel Macron said he would appoint a new prime minister in the coming days and his top priority would be getting a 2025 budget adopted by parliament. Despite Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigning on Thursday after losing a confidence vote on the budget, Macron insisted he would remain as president until his term ends in 2027. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, who voted to oust Barnier, said on Thursday she had no plans to seek the removal of Macron and a budget could be passed within weeks. French 10-year yields fell to 2-month lows, with the French-German spread compressing to two-week lows around 74bps. The CAC40 stock benchmark was up more than 1%. The European Central Bank meets next week amid widespread expectations of another quarter-point rate cut - the fourth of the year. In Asia, tensions remained in South Korea. The ruling party leader there said President Yoon Suk Yeol needed to be removed from power for trying to impose martial law and the government denied reports it was preparing to issue another such declaration. The won and the main KOSPI stock index both fell again. Chinese stocks outperformed, however, pushing aside U.S. trade-related anxieties amid expectations for fresh domestic policy support at next week's meeting of the Central Economic Work Conference - which will set the agenda and targets for China's economy for 2025. China's ministry of finance also published draft rules that would provide incentives for government agencies to buy China-made products, fuelling bets on home-grown technologies. Elsewhere, bitcoin recoiled below the $100,000 level it breached for the first time this week. President-elect Donald Trump said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\", another step towards overhauling U.S. policy toward the sector. In company news, UnitedHealth's stock dropped 5.2% on Thursday after the shocking murder of its chief executive in Manhattan on Wednesday and was the biggest weight on the Dow and S&P 500. The S&P 500 healthcare index fell 1.1% as health insurance companies reassessed the risks for their top executives. In deals news, Direct Line rose 8.5% after the British insurer said it was set to recommend a sweetened 3.61 billion pound ($4.60 billion) cash-and-stock takeover by Aviva if the bigger rival makes a formal offer. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * US November employment report, University of Michigan December consumer sentiment survey, October consumer credit; Canada Nov employment report * Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack and San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly all speak (Editing by Christina Fincher; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)"

  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter.

Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.

It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week.

  "title": "Forex Today : US Dollar consolidates losses as attention turns to Nonfarm Payrolls data",
  "content": " Here is what you need to know on Friday, December 6: The US Dollar (USD) holds its ground early Friday after weakening against its major rivals on Thursday. Investors await November jobs report, which will include Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), Unemployment Rate and wage inflation figures. The US economic calendar will also feature the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index. Finally, several Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers will deliver speeches on the last day before the blackout period starts. US Dollar PRICE This week The table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the weakest against the Swiss Franc. USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.00% -0.09% 0.03% 0.32% 1.31% 1.07% -0.18% EUR -0.00% -0.13% 0.03% 0.33% 1.40% 1.07% -0.16% GBP 0.09% 0.13% 0.13% 0.46% 1.54% 1.20% -0.06% JPY -0.03% -0.03% -0.13% 0.30% 1.32% 1.07% -0.26% CAD -0.32% -0.33% -0.46% -0.30% 1.14% 0.75% -0.51% AUD -1.31% -1.40% -1.54% -1.32% -1.14% -0.33% -1.57% NZD -1.07% -1.07% -1.20% -1.07% -0.75% 0.33% -1.22% CHF 0.18% 0.16% 0.06% 0.26% 0.51% 1.57% 1.22% The heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote). The USD Index came under bearish pressure and lost more than 0.5% on Thursday. In the European morning, the index stays in a consolidation phase below 106.00. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield fluctuates below 4.2% and US stock index futures trade mixed. Following the 12,000 increase recorded in October, NFP is forecast to rise by 200,000 in November. After climbing to a new record high above $100,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin reversed its direction and close the day in negative territory. Early Friday, BTC/USD trades at around $98,000. EUR/USD benefited from the broad-based USD weakness on Thursday and came within a touching distance of 1.0600. The pair edges slightly lower in the European morning on Friday but holds comfortably above 1.0550. Eurostat will publish revisions to third quarter Gross Domestic Product data. GBP/USD gathered bullish momentum and climbed to its highest level in three weeks above 1.2770 on Thursday. The pair trades marginally lower on the day slightly below 1.2750 to begin the European session. After rising for three consecutive days, USD/CAD reversed its direction and fell more than 0.3% on Thursday. The pair holds steady above 1.4000 early Friday. Statistics Canada will publish labor market data for November later in the day. USD/JPY edges lower and trades below 150.00 after posting small losses on Thursday. The data from Japan showed on Friday that Overall Household Spending declined by 1.3% on a yearly basis in October. This reading came in better than the market expectation for a decrease of 2.6%. Gold failed to capitalize on the selling pressure surrounding the USD and ended the day in the red on Thursday. After falling to its weakest level in over a week below $2,620 in the Asian session, XAU/USD gained traction and was last seen trading near $2,640. Nonfarm Payrolls FAQs Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) are part of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly jobs report. The Nonfarm Payrolls component specifically measures the change in the number of people employed in the US during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. The Nonfarm Payrolls figure can influence the decisions of the Federal Reserve by providing a measure of how successfully the Fed is meeting its mandate of fostering full employment and 2% inflation. A relatively high NFP figure means more people are in employment, earning more money and therefore probably spending more. A relatively low Nonfarm Payrolls’ result, on the either hand, could mean people are struggling to find work. The Fed will typically raise interest rates to combat high inflation triggered by low unemployment, and lower them to stimulate a stagnant labor market. Nonfarm Payrolls generally have a positive correlation with the US Dollar. This means when payrolls’ figures come out higher-than-expected the USD tends to rally and vice versa when they are lower. NFPs influence the US Dollar by virtue of their impact on inflation, monetary policy expectations and interest rates. A higher NFP usually means the Federal Reserve will be more tight in its monetary policy, supporting the USD. Nonfarm Payrolls are generally negatively-correlated with the price of Gold. This means a higher-than-expected payrolls’ figure will have a depressing effect on the Gold price and vice versa. Higher NFP generally has a positive effect on the value of the USD, and like most major commodities Gold is priced in US Dollars. If the USD gains in value, therefore, it requires less Dollars to buy an ounce of Gold. Also, higher interest rates (typically helped higher NFPs) also lessen the attractiveness of Gold as an investment compared to staying in cash, where the money will at least earn interest. Nonfarm Payrolls is only one component within a bigger jobs report and it can be overshadowed by the other components. At times, when NFP come out higher-than-forecast, but the Average Weekly Earnings is lower than expected, the market has ignored the potentially inflationary effect of the headline result and interpreted the fall in earnings as deflationary. The Participation Rate and the Average Weekly Hours components can also influence the market reaction, but only in seldom events like the “Great Resignation” or the Global Financial Crisis.

  "title": "Rise and grind : how  sigma male are upturning the internet",
  "content": " Wake up, 2:00am. Take a cold shower. Eat breakfast: 12 eggs and a side of raw milk. Workout, no warmup. Check crypto wallet for Bitcoin stocks. Listen to an audiobook rendition of Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra. “I am the ubermensch,” you utter, between gulps of fermented fish guts. No, this isn’t the diary of an on-screen sociopath. In fact, it’s the imagined schedule of a sigma male, the latest socio-sexual identity to take over the internet. The nebulous term is meant to describe someone who’s the paragon of masculinity: having broken the binaries of the Chad alpha and Virgin beta, he is the wolf without a pack, operating outside of social systems and hierarchies. According to online descriptions, he is successful and popular, but also silent and rebellious. He has a near-fundamentalist approach to self-improvement and is well-tuned in the ways of hustle culture. He makes regular gains at the gym and invests in crypto – sometimes simultaneously. First coined by far-right activist and writer Theodore Robert Beale on a fringe nationalist blog in 2010, the sigma male describes an introverted alpha male who likes to “play by his own rules”. Proliferated on 4chan forums and esoteric right-wing fitness circles, the sigma mindset – or grindset – is associated with motivational speakers like Joe Rogan and GaryVee. But its archaic views on masculinity, paired with ample lashings of corporate cringe, feel bafflingly extreme. In one so-called motivational video, Vaynerchuk asks an audience member to motivate themselves by imagining a relative getting shot in the face, while in another, he goes in-depth on how hustle culture will make you rich. The content parodies itself. Corresponding Instagram pages like @entrepreneurshipfacts, @billionaire_word, and @billionairebullclub take this even further: hyper-masculine affirmations encourage its readers to find prosperity, self-growth, and financial freedom through a strict programme of lifestyle practises that emphasise self-discipline and individual empowerment (AKA “grindset”). These are typically paired with images of successful and attractive ‘sigma men’ from across the IRL and fictional manscape – Keanu Reeves’ John Wick, Leonardo DiCaprio, and American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman are repeat offenders. Like other spurious internet male archetypes, such as the incel and doomer, the sigma mindset is rooted in feelings of being misunderstood. He is generally depicted as a dark-intellectual genius who’s too wise and brooding for conventional society. Yet rather than resign himself to despondency, he adheres to perennial masculine ideals of success – defined loosely as financial and physical gains. To achieve his jacked-up appearance, the sigma must partake in a number of hypermasculine rituals, such as consuming supplements and steroids. The result feels more like an amalgamation of Men’s Health cover stars than any realistic masculine form – and yet it’s not uncommon to stumble across /fit/ Reddit advocating for weird bro science methods of improving masculine appearances, from seed retention (not masturbating) to ball-sunning (literally sunning your balls). With the tagline “become a demigod”, fitness site Herculean Strength encourages its readers to buy testosterone-boosting supplements (read: steroids) to enhance their sigma male prospects. The combination of capitalism, and the subsequent unrealistic beauty standards imposed on men, makes the so-called sigma community a hotbed for reactionary conservatism. The popularity of the archetype reflects our current neoliberal climate, where everyone is a commodity and products are catered to appeal to people’s biggest anxieties and aspirations. For example, Sol Brah, one of the members of Right Wing Bodybuilders (RWBB), released his own branded supplements last year. His followers, who call themselves #LAMBROS, believe that combining nutritionally-informed lifting routine with a crypto grindset will make them ripped and afford a Lamborghini. “I think people really keyed in on sigma because it’s salient in the world of gig labour, hustle culture, and courtship driven by dating apps. Over the years I’ve noticed this attitude (of people wanting to) just focus on money… You can fill your time with awkward dates, being ghosted, and hookups, or you could just stack cash and self-actualise,” says the anonymous admin behind Instagram meme account @5d.4n4l.53x. Given the extremity of the sigma grindset – the ripped abs, the glamour muscles, the hard hustle merged with unsettling levels of corporate aspiration – it’s unsurprising that alt-left meme accounts began to create their own parodies last year. “The problem with defining the sigma male is that all of their fundamental characteristics are completely made-up by an intensely toxic and misogynistic community that believe in concepts like the social-sexual hierarchy,” explains @phonewifey, a musician and sigma-focused meme-maker. “This isn’t to say there aren’t people who genuinely aspire to become ‘the rarest male archetype’, but I think those people are greatly outnumbered by less red-pilled people who have latched onto the concept as a meme.” via Instagram (@fraud.cool) The rising popularity of sigma memes comes at a time when the pandemic has exposed the failures of capitalism, through rising unemployment, stagnating wages, and soaring inflation. This not only highlights the drawbacks of hustle culture but makes the sigma’s Thatcherite work ethic feel particularly tone deaf in the current climate. By doubling down on the absurdity of these statements, memes operate as a meta-commentary on the socio-economic pressures of modern-day living – and, by extension, the toxic expectations put on men today. “There is undeniable pressure on men to behave in a way that, under the wrong circumstances, can foster many bad traits,” says the admin behind meme account @doyoueverjustfuckingascend. “Combine that with western hyper-individualism and it could create a real sense of isolation.” It also reflects the increasing ways in which labels play a role in shaping and defining our identity online. As with all memetic identities (see: astrology, Myers-Briggs, The Political Compass), it’s a composite of its characteristics – an arbitrary label akin to putting INFP in your Twitter bio or taking The Political Compass and concluding that you’re lib-left. “I think for some boys and young men looking to validate their masculinity or make sense of their role in the world with daunting masculine expectations from their peers, this kind of alpha/sigma/beta identity system can be grounding and fits nicely with internet-era identity formation,” agrees @5d.4n4l.53x. “It piggybacks off this folklore that we’re social creatures in a rugged state of social nature, fighting for dominance and resources (like women, because we’re reward-objects) that seems a mainstay of modern patriarchal culture.” Interestingly, there’s no female equivalent to the sigma. The closest is perhaps the #girlboss, whose millennial pink-hued hustle ethos can be condensed into perfect ‘that girl’ morning routine” TikToks and “you’ve got as many hours in the day as Beyonce” quotes. But these don’t come anywhere near the ever-expanding socio-sexual hierarchy of archetypes that categorise online masculinity today. The latest archetype to land in the manscape, for example, is the zeta male – defined on Urban Dictionary as “the human equivalent of an F1 car” and “the rarest male breed”. There’s also the theta male – “a mystic and an ascetic; a male who is dedicated to fully embodying a disciplined and purifying spiritual lifestyle”. So, perhaps the era of the sigma male is ending. Even so, the introduction of more male archetypes into the manscape ad infinitum will do nothing but exacerbate masculinity’s ongoing identity crisis. The only real solution is to challenge the system that helped build these identities in the first place. via Reddit"

  "title": "Bitcoin soars past $100 , 000 in latest rally amid hopes of deregulation | NewsRadio 740 KTRH",
  "content": "KTRH Local Houston and Texas NewsBitcoin has seen its share of roller coaster rides, going up and down basically since its anonymous inception in 2009. It has seen massive crashes in 2018 and again in 2022 amid various market circumstances. But it has been on the rise the las year and a half and has even hit new highs as of a few days ago. The price of the cryptocurrency surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time ever this week, peaking around $103,000. As of the time of this article, it has dipped back to $97,000, but it is still sitting at heights it has not seen, breaking barriers no one really thought it could. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said before that Bitcoin is not a threat to the US Dollar but may give gold a run for its money. The recent surge certainly opens up the argument. So, the question has to be asked: will Bitcoin ever become widely used? Money and Business Expert Derrick Kinney says this recent surge has been because of the Donald Trump election win, giving hope for a new era of deregulation. \"We have seen crypto has a place, and have seen wider adoption institutionally with companies,\" he says. \"We will also probably see a wider acceptance of other financial options...and much less regulation, which tends to be good for the stock market.\" The Biden Administration has been placing staunch regulations on all types of businesses, including on Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is no stranger to that, having had regulations slapped on them starting in 2012. Trump has made it a platform of his to begin reversing the strict regulations when he arrives in office, which again, is bringing hope, especially back to heavily regulated businesses. But, while Trump may be good for the crypto game, there is a slight hitch in the giddy up. \"What Trump has done for crypto...will this have the same positive effect when tariffs kick in on various products,\" he says. \"Some analysts are nervous of the impacts...while people may make gain in crypto, they may then lose it paying for products.\" As mentioned, Fed Chair Powell has said that Bitcoin may be like the new gold. People tend to stock up on metals during hard times in the economy, as a 'rainy day fund' of sorts. But gold you can hold in your hand and physically see it. Bitcoin is just online encrypted currency, with no physical presence. However, that is what makes it even more appealing. \"Crypto you cannot feel or touch it, but it is not part of the US Dollar system,\" he says. The recent surge may have you thinking about investing money into the crypto game. But Kinney adds that you should only spend money you can afford to lose. Because as we know all too well with Bitcoin, it could plummet, and you could lose it. Bitcoin has risen 42 percent since Election night alone, and over 133 percent in 2024.

  "title": "Dave Portnoy Blames Winklevoss Twins For Confusing Him Into Selling Bitcoin Too Early",
  "content": "Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy has taken a lighthearted jab at himself and the Winklevoss twins, recounting a costly decision to sell his Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings after a perplexing conversation with the famed crypto advocates. What Happened: In a tweet, Portnoy revealed he had purchased $2 million worth of Bitcoin at $11,000 per coin in 2020, only to sell it all shortly after a discussion with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Bitcoin is now trading at $98,000, after making an all time high of $103,679 on December 12, leaving Portnoy lamenting, \"I've been chasing it ever since. Dave is sad.\" In a resurfaced video accompanying the tweet, Portnoy humorously recalls being utterly baffled by the twins' explanation of Bitcoin, particularly their claim about the potential for Elon Musk to mine gold from asteroids. \"If he mines all the gold in the asteroids above Earth, then all of a sudden gold is going to fall from the sky and be as plentiful as sand,\" the twins had explained. Also Read: Anthony Pompliano Says Countries Are ‘Going To FOMO’ Into Buying Bitcoin Reacting to their comments, Portnoy admitted in the video, “I literally have no idea what Bitcoin is,” adding that parts of their conversation sounded like jokes but were delivered with dead seriousness. His confusion led him to offload his Bitcoin holdings, a decision he now regrets as Bitcoin's price has surged nearly tenfold since then. The video captures Portnoy's struggle to grasp the concept of Bitcoin, pointing out the complexities that can come with understanding digital assets. His candid admission about selling too soon offers a relatable moment for many investors who have found themselves perplexed by cryptocurrency's nuances.

  "title": "Bitcoin Reaches $100 , 000 Milestone Before Slipping : What Investors Need To Know",
  "content": " Bitcoin made history on December 4 by surpassing $100,000 for the first time before sliding below the milestone less than 24 hours later. The cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a central concern for investors, even as its growing role in financial markets becomes clearer. The price of Bitcoin dramatically peaked at $103,844.05 late Wednesday but settled at around $99,140 by Thursday afternoon, according to Coin Metrics. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, called the milestone a “paradigm shift” for digital assets. “Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” he said. What fueled the rise? President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance partly buoyed Bitcoin’s surge. He nominated Paul Atkins as SEC chair, a move widely seen as favorable for the industry. Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly approach, is expected to replace Gary Gensler, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Investor sentiment also drove the rise in Bitcoin’s price. As Bitcoin climbed, it triggered a wave of short position liquidations, wiping out over $132 million in just a few hours. Its dominance in the crypto market increased to 57%, further solidifying its influence. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index climbed to a high of 94 on November 22 before settling at an “extreme greed” level of 84 after the latest rally. Social sentiment reflected the euphoria in the market, and Google Trends reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin-related searches on Thursday. Yet, experts caution against too much optimism. “It’s volatile, unpredictable, and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. The risk of corrections Bitcoin’s rapid dip below $100,000 highlights the dangers of profit-taking and market corrections. This cycle of sharp rises and sudden declines has defined Bitcoin’s history. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted, Bitcoin functions more like digital gold than a traditional currency. Despite its ups and downs, Bitcoin has gained over 133% this year and 42% since the election. These numbers attract both seasoned investors and newcomers, driven by the fear of missing out. Yet, analysts like Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of cryptocurrency Tezos, warn that markets driven by momentum require caution. While some view Bitcoin as a store of value, others remain skeptical of its ability to stabilize. The potential for regulatory changes under the incoming administration could pave the way for further adoption, but it also adds uncertainty. For now, Bitcoin’s crossing of the $100,000 threshold is a historic achievement, but its journey ahead will likely remain as volatile as ever. Investors are advised to tread carefully, keeping in mind both its immense potential and its significant risks. "

  "title": "Stock market today : World stocks are mixed ahead of a key US jobs report",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter.Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.

  "title": "Veteran Trader Warns Against  Aggressive Long  Positions On Bitcoin , Equities Amid Market Volatility - Invesco QQQ Trust , Series 1 ( NASDAQ : QQQ ) ",
  "content": "Seasoned trader and analyst Jason Shapiro reflected on Thursday’s sharp pullback in Bitcoin BTC/USD and the stock market, warning against going “aggressively long” on risk-on assets until year-end. What Happened: In a video posted on his official YouTube channel, Shapiro said, \"I will say something that nobody wants to say and nobody wants to hear, which is, I don’t think from now at least until year-end is a great time to be aggressively long risk assets.\" Shapiro acknowledged the record highs scaled in both markets recently but argued against going long from a risk-to-reward perspective. \"It just doesn’t feel right to me. It starts getting too easy, and when it gets too easy is when it really is going to start getting hard,\" the experienced trader shared his thoughts. See Also: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Drives MicroStrategy’s 490% Surge, Hedge Fund CIO Says It’s An ‘Extreme Example’ Of Volatility Monetization Shapiro also questioned the market’s growing consensus on a “Christmas Rally” and a subsequent retracement in the new year. \"Well, who in their right mind is going to buy it into Christmas if they think it’s going to go down into January?\" For the uninitiated, Shapiro is known for his contrarian approach, which means going short during bullish euphoria and going long during bearish sentiment. Why It Matters: Shapiro's bearish prediction comes amid a sharp retracement in both Bitcoin and Wall Street stocks. While the world's leading cryptocurrency flash crashed to nearly $92,000 after breaking beyond $100,000 just a day earlier, major averages like the S&P 500 SPY and the Nasdaq Composite QQQ snapped their record-breaking streak by falling 0.19% and 0.17%, respectively. According to TradingView, Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, was 6 at the time of writing. This implied that investment in the cryptocurrency was generating positive returns above the risk-free rate. Similarly, the S&P 500's Sharpe Ratio showed a reading of 1.13, indicating a better risk-adjusted return potential. Price Action: As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $97,678.87, pulling back 4.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The S&P 500 dropped 0.19% to end at 6,075.11 during Thursday's regular session.

When FOX Business host Stuart Varney asked the Canadian politician whether she knew if she was \"killing the planet\" by exporting oil, she replied: \"We have 200 billion barrels of oil in reserve that's recoverable.\"\"We've got 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. And we also have pore space that is probably the best in the world, next only to Russia,\" she added. \"I think we're a better trading partner and friend than Russia. And so we have a plan to take carbon dioxide, capture it and bury it, carbon capture utilization and storage. We have already done this at scale. We've already safely sequestered 14 million tons of CO2.

  "title": "Ethereum To Pull A BTC 2021 - Like Rally ? Analyst Weighs In",
  "content": " As Bitcoin finally soars above the long-awaited $100,000 milestone, Ethereum (ETH) attempts to break out from a key resistance zone. The second-largest crypto rally has fueled optimism about its targets, with some suggesting that it could mimic BTC’s 2020-2021 rally. Ethereum Reclaims $3,900 Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recorded a 10% surge in the past week, moving from the $3,500 mark to the $3,900 resistance. On Wednesday, the King of Altcoins surpassed the $3,800 level for the first time in six months and continued climbing to retest the $3,900 resistance, not seen since early March. In the early hours of Thursday, ETH turned this key zone into support, briefly dipping to $3,860 before jumping back to the recently reclaimed level. As the cryptocurrency nears its yearly high of $4,093, sentiment around the token’s short-term performance has turned extremely bullish. Ethereum is retesting a massive multi-year resistance zone, which could send ETH to a new ATH. According to analyst Alex Clay, the cryptocurrency attempts to break “through the Key Resistance Zone on the weekly timeframe.” ETH has rested the key zone five times since 2021, facing rejection from the upper resistance at $3,950 on four occasions before. However, Ethereum broke past this level in late 2021, when it hit its all-time high (ATH) and held above it for nearly three months. The analyst noted that if the King of Altcoins successfully breaks above this level and turns it into support, it will be the next “to break through” and smash its ATH. Clay added that he sees “no major pullback in the near time.” Similarly, crypto analyst Jelle stated that if Ethereum breaks above the March high, “all bets are off,” suggesting that the chances of ETH taking a long consolidation period before a new ATH like BTC did were “very low.” ETH To Rally Toward $10,000? Jelle also noted that Ethereum’s current setup mimicked Bitcoin’s in July 2020. Per the chart, Bitcoin broke through a multi-year downtrend line by mid-2020, followed by a massive 500% 10-month rally toward the $60,000 mark in April 2021. ETH’s setup resembles Bitcoin’s 2020-2021 chart. Source: Crypto Jelle on X The analyst noted that ETH breached the multi-year trendline today, like BTC in 2020, which could trigger a similar rally toward new highs in the next few months. He added that investors are “in for a treat if this plays out anything similar.” In another post, he highlighted that Ethereum started rallying when Bitcoin broke its ATH and entered price discovery when BTC traded nearly 100% above its previous cycle high. He considers that it would be surprising to “see things play out similarly this time around. BTC & ETH climbing in tandem, leading to ETH entering price discovery somewhere around ±$130,000.” Based on this, the analyst believes that a 150-200% rally toward the $10,000-$12,000 price range for the cryptocurrency is possible for this cycle. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,905, a 2.4% increase in the daily timeframe. Ethereum’s performance in the weekly chart.

Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

  "title": "Bitcoin at $100 , 000 : Milestone likely to boost Indian investor rush",
  "content": "The recent Bitcoin rally, which saw the cryptocurrency surge past the $100,000 mark on Thursday, is drawing Indian investors in droves. Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters Cryptocurrency platforms in India are experiencing a significant uptick in activity and user sign-ups, driven by the optimism surrounding “crypto-friendly” Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. “We’ve seen a five to six times increase in trading volume on our platform,” says Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch, a major crypto exchange. “Every metric — from new customer acquisition to people visiting the platform, people trading on our platform, and the trading volume — has surged, with some metrics climbing by as much as ten times.” With rise in the VDA’s (virtual digital asset’s) value, more investors are turning to it as a feasible investment opportunity. Trump’s appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who had cracked down on digital assets following the 2022 market crash, is expected to further fuel the rally. Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, a leading crypto exchange, notes the increase in user registrations. “We’re seeing a five to six times expansion in new user sign-ups. \"Trading volumes have increased by over 300 per cent due to the growing interest in this rally,” Gupta explains. Founders of crypto firms anticipate the rally will continue through the first half of 2025, supported by a steady influx of new users. “We’re seeing a lot of old users coming back, checking their portfolio, and either buying or selling some of it. \"These are known as reactivations. Also, I expect that a lot of new users will come in over the next few months,” said Edul Patel, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Mudrex. For the second consecutive year, India has continued to lead the way in global cryptocurrency adoption in 2024, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. At present, India has around 40 million active crypto investors, suggest industry estimates. Indian investors are now viewing Bitcoin as a viable option for wealth creation, said Thangapandi Durai, CEO, Koinpark. “For Indian investors, this (the $100,000 milestone) is a prime opportunity to recognise that cryptocurrencies offer substantial capital appreciation potential. \"Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ provides a hedge against inflation while serving as a store of value.” Some experts warn investors to approach cryptocurrencies with caution due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintains its cautious stance, warning that cryptocurrencies pose risks to the financial and monetary stability of the country. \"Investors should conduct proper research and not view cryptos as a shortcut to 50x or 100x returns within months. \"A disciplined, long-term approach is necessary,” advised Purvang Mashru, senior quantitative research analyst at 1 Finance.

Other nominations include former Sen. David Perdue as U.S. Ambassador to China, Brandon Judd as Ambassador to Chile and Tony Salisbury as deputy Homeland Security advisor.Trump also named venture capitalist David Sacks as his so-called White House AI and Crypto Czar. Digital money like Bitcoin has skyrocketed in the wake of Trump's election despite experts' warnings of risky investments without the backing of a centralized bank. But Trump says he wants to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and has voiced plans of creating a strategic reserve of Bitcoin. His appointment of Sacks and Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission are seen as crypto-friendly moves, further driving up Bitcoin's value. But, it's Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who still faces a challenging confirmation process.Hegseth appeared on Capitol Hill this week to appeal to senators amid allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault, and controversial opinions about women's roles in the military.\"This process has been a very good one despite all the noise on the outside,\" Hegseth said to a crowd of reporters. \"As long as President Trump wants me in this fight, I'm going to be standing right here in this fight - fighting to bring the Pentagon back to what it needs to be.\"Some Senators have debated their involvement in the vetting and confirmation process.\"Who are we to say that we're a better vetter and picker of people than Donald Trump?\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville said. \"That's not our job to do that. That's the Democrats.\"Democrats have pushed back.\"The Constitution says that every one of us must advise and consent on every nominee made by the president,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. \"Individually, we take an oath not to a president, but to the Constitution. And I think that any senator who says I'm just going to vote in favor of whoever the president sends up because the president has vetted him enough is really violating their oath of office.\" "

  "title": "5 Best Coins to Invest in This Month : Get Ahead of the Crowd",
  "content": " The cryptocurrency market never sleeps, and each month brings new opportunities to shake up your portfolio. December is no different, with fresh trends, innovative projects, and tokens poised for explosive growth. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or someone looking to dip your toes in, getting ahead of the crowd is key. Among the top contenders this month is Qubetics ($TICS), a Web3 aggregator that’s making waves with its presale success and innovative approach to real-world blockchain applications. Let’s dive into five of the best coins to invest in this month and why these tokens deserve a spot in your portfolio. 1. Qubetics: The Star of the Month Imagine owning a piece of real estate or art worth millions—tokenised into bite-sized digital assets you can trade like stocks. That’s the magic of Qubetics’ Asset Tokenisation platform. It takes physical and digital assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, turns them into tradable tokens, and makes them accessible to everyone. With Qubetics, decentralised finance isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a transformative tool for investors from all walks of life. Imagine Jane, a small business owner in Ohio, tokenising her café property to raise capital, or Sam, a 20-something crypto enthusiast in New York, diversifying his portfolio with tokenised gold. Qubetics makes these scenarios possible through advanced features like Cosmos SDK, post-quantum cryptography, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance to ensure security and reliability. The buzz around Qubetics is more than hype. With over $4.4 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.0282 per token, early investors are looking at a jaw-dropping ROI of 783% by the end of the presale. If you invest $10,000 now, you could turn that into $78,300—or potentially $150,000 if the post-presale $5 target hits. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just a project; it’s a revolution in blockchain adoption. With predictions as high as $15 after its mainnet launch, this is one of the best coins to invest in this month. 2. Kaspa (KAS): The Speed Demon Kaspa is a high-speed Layer-1 blockchain that has solved the infamous blockchain trilemma: security, decentralisation, and scalability. With block intervals of just one second, it’s the fastest proof-of-work chain out there. Its simplicity appeals to developers, while its speed makes it a favourite for traders. In recent weeks, Kaspa has gained attention for its growing dApp ecosystem and upcoming updates designed to optimise mining efficiency. Analysts predict its price could double by Q1 2025. A $10,000 investment in KAS now could set you up with a significant profit within months. Why did this coin make it to this list? Kaspa’s unmatched speed and scalability make it a strong contender for December, especially with developers flocking to build on its network. 3. Stacks (STX): Bringing Bitcoin to Smart Contracts Stacks bridges the gap between Bitcoin and smart contracts, allowing developers to build dApps on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its Clarity programming language ensures security and simplicity, which has attracted projects ranging from DeFi platforms to NFTs. Stacks’ recent collaboration with major DeFi players hints at a bullish future. Experts believe its price could hit a new high by mid-2025. Your $10,000 investment today could turn into massive gains if those predictions hold. Why did this coin make it to this list? Stacks’ unique proposition of empowering Bitcoin with smart contracts makes it an undeniable pick this month. 4. Quant (QNT): The Interoperability King Quant is revolutionising the blockchain landscape with its focus on seamless connectivity. At the heart of its innovation is Overledger, a groundbreaking technology that allows different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. This solution bridges gaps in the fragmented blockchain ecosystem, making Quant a key player for enterprise-level adoption. From enhancing efficiency in healthcare systems to streamlining banking operations, Quant’s utility extends across industries. It’s not just about crypto enthusiasts anymore—major institutions are taking notice. The ability to integrate blockchain technology into existing systems without the usual complexity makes Quant an indispensable tool for enterprises worldwide. Why did this coin make it to this list? Quant’s enterprise-grade solutions position it as a long-term winner, with strong momentum this month. 5. Aptos (APT): The Solana Rival Aptos has earned its reputation as a game-changing blockchain, often referred to as the “Solana killer” for its impressive speed and innovation. Its architecture prioritises scalability, security, and efficiency, making it a magnet for developers seeking a robust platform to build decentralised applications (dApps). The blockchain’s recent mainnet upgrade has further solidified its position as a leader in the space, addressing scalability challenges while maintaining a high level of security. This combination of performance and reliability has attracted a thriving ecosystem of projects, from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms, making Aptos a significant force in the crypto world. Why did this coin make it to this list? Aptos’ advanced technology and rapidly expanding ecosystem make it a standout contender, offering a glimpse into the future of blockchain innovation. Conclusion Ready to pivot to one of the best coins to invest in this month? The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities this December, and these five tokens stand out as the cream of the crop. From Qubetics’ game-changing asset tokenisation to Kaspa’s blazing speed, there’s something for every kind of investor here. But let’s be honest: Qubetics is the one coin you can’t afford to overlook. With its presale nearing a price hike, now is the time to jump in. Don’t miss your chance to ride the $TICS wave—your financial future might just thank you.

The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $73.8 billion in October versus a revised $83.8 billion gap in the previous month and compared to market estimates of a $75 billion gap.

He added that the S&P 500 hitting the 6,300 level by the end of the year is \"very doable.\" At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,062, down 4.43% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro data. On the other hand, Sonu Varghese, Vice President, Global Macro Strategist at Carson Group, flagged a Fed policy error as a \"big risk for 2025.\" Varghese's warning comes after Powell's comments about rate cuts earlier this week signaled that the Fed chair is willing to be patient, instead of rushing through with the cuts as earlier thought. He thinks that stubborn inflation could force the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to be more cautious with stepping on the rate cut pedal. Varghese anticipates that elevated inflation could result in no rate cuts for as long as the first half of 2025. \"Ultimately, if the Fed does pause for an extended period of time, that's going to be on the back of spurious, backward-looking inflation data, rather than what's happening in reality.\" \"Meanwhile, policy would implicitly be getting tighter, as policy rates stay elevated and underlying inflation remains muted. That's a big risk for cyclical sectors of the economy,\" he added. See Also: How To Trade Futures Upcoming Economic Data Friday's economic calendar consists of some crucial data releases.

  "title": "Trump Trade Policies Pose Greater Risk To South Korea Economy Than Domestic Martial Law Crisis , Says Central Bank Chief :  A Lot More Uncertainty  ",
  "content": "The governor of the Bank of Korea, Rhee Chang-yong, expressed that the South Korean economy is more threatened by the trade policies of President-elect Donald Trump than the current political crisis in the country. What Happened: Rhee Chang-yong has indicated that the fallout from President Yoon Suk Yeol’s unsuccessful attempt to impose martial law this week will postpone “critical structural reforms” to the South Korean economy and financial markets, reported the Financial Times on Thursday. However, he is of the opinion that the economic impact of this political crisis will be “limited” in comparison to the potential repercussions for Korean exporters due to the rise in Chinese competition and the anticipated heavy tariffs from Trump on the US’s leading trade partners. Rhee stated, “There is a lot of uncertainty. But compared with domestic factors, the external factors are giving us a lot more uncertainty at the moment.” He pointed out Trump’s tariff threat as one of the primary reasons for downgrading South Korea’s growth forecast for this year and the next. See Also: Fed Chair Powell: Bitcoin Is ‘Like Gold, It’s Just Virtual And Digital’ Why It Matters: South Korea’s economy, the fourth largest in Asia, was already struggling with weak domestic demand, high household debt, and increased competition from Chinese exporters. Last week, the central bank unexpectedly reduced interest rates, with Rhee expressing concerns over Trump’s victory and Republican gains in the U.S. Despite the political unrest, investors have remained relatively calm. The country’s Kospi stock benchmark was down 6% by the close of trading on Thursday from Tuesday’s close. Rhee attributed “swift and comprehensive prevention measures” to quickly calming and stabilizing the financial market. Trump’s trade policies have been a cause for concern not only in South Korea but also in other countries. A Goldman Sachs report warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs could lead to significant economic costs, particularly for Canada and Mexico. The report estimated that the GDP of these countries could shrink by as much as 4% under Trump’s full 25% tariff proposal. Analysts have also raised concerns about the potential repercussions of Trump’s tariffs on the U.S. economy, including the defense sector. A senior adviser from Beijing warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods could severely affect American manufacturers, potentially reducing U.S. GDP growth by half.

  "title": "Why Qubetics , Polkadot , and Bitcoin Cash Are the Best Cryptos to Join Today",
  "content": "Crypto enthusiasts are riding high on exciting developments, with Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash making bold headlines. Polkadot recently shattered records with 60 million monthly transactions, a threefold increase from earlier this year. This milestone highlights its growing adoption and the surge in dApps leveraging its scalable network. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash has broken through the $600 barrier, reflecting its bullish momentum. With predictions of BCH hitting $750 in the near future, the spotlight is on its role as a fast and efficient peer-to-peer electronic cash system. While Polkadot and Bitcoin Cash are thriving, Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the show as one of the best cryptos to join today.

Its multi-chain wallet offers a seamless solution to security and usability issues that have plagued the crypto world. For anyone looking to invest in the future of finance, $TICS stands out as one of the best cryptos to join today.SPONSOR AD Qubetics: The Future of Multi-Chain WalletsQubetics is shaking up the world of cryptocurrency wallets, offering a solution that’s as innovative as it is practical. Its multi-chain wallet allows users to store, manage, and transact across multiple blockchains through a single, secure interface.

Whether you’re a casual investor or a business processing dozens of transactions daily, Qubetics makes it simple, efficient, and safe.

With Qubetics’ wallet, you can seamlessly manage Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana payments in one interface while enjoying top-tier security features. The wallet’s gasless $TICS transactions add even more value, cutting costs and improving the payment experience for your business and your customers.The innovation doesn’t stop there.

A $5,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.0282 nets you 177,304 $TICS tokens. By the time the presale price climbs to $0.25, that initial investment skyrockets to $44,326—a 783% ROI. And that’s just the beginning. Analysts are forecasting post-presale prices of $5 per token, turning your $5,000 into a life-changing $886,520.

  "title": "David Sacks : Who is David Sacks ? Elon Musk former PayPal ally turned AI & Crypto Czar in Trump administration | World News",
  "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Thursday that former PayPal executive David Sacks will serve as the White House Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar in his new administration.Trump made the announcement on his official social media platform, Truth Social, saying:“I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the White House AI & Crypto Czar. In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.”Who is David Sacks?David Sacks, 52, is a prominent entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and technology leader. He is the co-founder of Craft Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, and an early executive at PayPal, the payment processing company acquired by eBay in 2002.Sacks is considered part of the \"PayPal Mafia,\" a group of former PayPal employees and executives who have achieved significant success in tech and business. This group includes figures like Peter Thiel and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk has also been appointed by Trump to co-lead the department of government efficiency (DOGE) in his new administration.Born in South Africa, Sacks has an extensive entrepreneurial background. He served as CEO of Zenefits, a software company, and founded Yammer, an enterprise social network acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion.Sacks is also well-known as a co-host of the All-In Podcast, a leading technology podcast where he and his colleagues discuss economic, political, and social issues.“David has the knowledge, business experience, intelligence, and pragmatism to MAKE AMERICA GREAT in these two critical technologies. Congratulations, David!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Advocate for cryptocurrencyA vocal proponent of cryptocurrency, Sacks has described the rise of Bitcoin as a revolutionary moment for the internet. In a 2017 interview with CNBC, he said: \"It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money.\"In his new role under Trump’s administration, Sacks will focus on maintaining the United States' leadership in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. He will also work to protect online free speech and address perceived biases and censorship by major tech companies. Additionally, Sacks will oversee a White House advisory council on science and technology, according to Trump.Tiff with MuskElon Musk was removed as PayPal's CEO over 20 years ago by the \"PayPal Mafia,\" according to Walter Isaacson's book 'Elon Musk'. The book explores disagreements over the company's direction following the merger of Musk's X.com with Confinity.Musk clashed with co-founder Max Levchin on fraud prevention measures, particularly Levchin's CAPTCHA tool, which Musk reportedly doubted. The conflict escalated when colleagues questioned Musk's leadership. A study showed that PayPal’s brand was stronger than X.com’s, prompting Musk to attempt removing PayPal branding from the website, according to a Fox Business report.In September 2000, while Musk was on his honeymoon in Australia, investor Peter Thiel, board member Reid Hoffman, and product chief David Sacks worked with others to replace him, according to a Fox Business report. Levchin proposed Thiel as interim CEO, a move supported by the board. Musk was informed of the change via email. Despite cutting his honeymoon short, the board voted to remove him as CEO.Musk told Isaacson: \"I was pretty angry at first. I had thoughts of assassination running through my head. But eventually, I realized that it was good I got coup’ed. Otherwise, I’d still be slaving away at PayPal… Of course, if I had stayed, PayPal would be a trillion-dollar company.\""

  "title": "Record Bitcoin Rally Results in $676 Million of Trader Liquidations",
  "content": " Key Takeaways Bitcoin and the crypto market’s record rally has resulted in traders expressing extreme greed, liquidating approximately $676.21 million in long and short positions as they exited the market over the past 24 hours. Out of these liquidations, long positions predicting prices to rise accounted for $372.79 million, while short positions expecting prices to drop saw $303.42 million in liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC) led the chart with $182.52 million in overall liquidations, with $134.82 million in short positions and $47.69 million in long positions. Ethereum (ETH) registered $92.1 million in liquidations, with $61.15 million in long and $31.01 million in short positions. Crypto exchanges OKX, Binance, and Bitget saw the largest liquidation transactions, totaling $582 million. The biggest individual liquidation transaction occurred on Bitget, which was $8.9 million worth of BTC/USD position. Bitcoin has been on a record-breaking run ever since Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the U.S. Presidential elections, registering an all-time high of $104,000 on December 5, 2024. However, CoinGlass data revealed that traders took full advantage of the massive breakout by liquidating over $650 million worth of cryptocurrencies. Traders Liquidate $676.21 Million In BTC, ETH, XRP, And SOL Amid Bull Run Over the past 24 hours, 208,238 traders liquidated approximately $676.21 million in various cryptocurrencies, with long positions accounting for most of these at $372.79 million, while short positions witnessed $303.42 million in overall liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC) led the chart with liquidations worth $182.52 million, with data showing that most of these exits were by traders who took a short position expecting the price of the flagship cryptocurrency to fall, valued at $134.82 million. Meanwhile, long positions in Bitcoin saw a loss of $47.69 million. Ethereum (ETH) traders came in second, facing losses of approximately $92.16 million. More than $61 million in short positions and $31.01 million in ETH long positions were liquidated. Whereas in the case of Ripple (XRP), there were more long traders ($39.41 million) liquidating than short traders ($16.49 million). Other popular large-cap altcoins, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL), saw losses of more than $100 million, while the rest of the market contributed to an additional $114 million in losses. Majority of Liquidations Were By Long Traders Who Profit From Rising Token Prices OKX, Binance, and Bybit exchanges were where the biggest liquidations took place. These platforms registered liquidations of $260 million, $163 million, and $159 million, respectively. The single-largest individual liquidation occurred on Bybit, which was a short BTC/USD position worth $8.9 million. Interestingly, 56% of the liquidations came from traders in long positions, who were betting on the prices to rise. Given the prevailing bullish sentiment and the sudden price drops of leading crypto tokens like XRP and Hedera (HBAR) in the last 24 hours, this outcome was not a surprise. The liquidations were largely driven by Bitcoin’s bullish performance over the past week. The apex crypto asset’s price peaked on December 4, when it crossed the psychological level of $100,000. Experts believe this triggered extreme greed among traders, who rushed to exit their positions and cash out the profits. Despite the increased liquidations, data shows that the trading volume of Bitcoin surged by 88.19% to hit $128.20 billion as investor interest in the digital currency continues to grow. Since crossing the coveted $100,000 mark, the price of BTC has remained fairly stable between $103,500 and $101,600. In the case of Ethereum, the coin has registered a 5.29% increase in its price to trade at a high of $3,930. The world’s second-largest crypto asset’s market volume is up 48.21% to $65.74 billion. However, XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw its price dip by 7.9% in the last 24 hours to $2.40, with market volume dropping by 26.90% to $26.48 billion.

  "title": "Liquidations in Bitcoin , Altcoins Cooling Off",
  "content": "Market Picture The crypto market cap has shrunk to $3.6 trillion, down around 2% in the last 24 hours. The main volatility has been in Bitcoin, with Ethereum affected to a lesser extent and a barely noticeable ripple at the altcoin level. This is a strong signal of a short-term shakeout but not a change in sentiment. Thursday’s US session saw a strong wave of profit-taking, which quickly turned into a liquidation of marginal long positions. Both bullish and bearish liquidation created a swing range of almost 13% in less than 24 hours. At its lowest point, the price of Bitcoin was down to $91,000. By early European trading, it had stabilised just below $98,000, back to where it started the day on Thursday. Other stars of recent flights are also cooling off. Tron has stabilised around $0.32, roughly in the middle of this week’s range. XRP is cooling off, pulling back to $2.30, which is near the 76.4% level from the early November lows. News Background There is a strong correlation between Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000 and Tether’s increased supply of USDT stablecoin, said CEO Paolo Ardoino. Over the past 20 days, the stablecoin’s capitalisation has increased by approximately $16 billion. CryptoQuant identified significant institutional demand from US investors based on Coinbase’s premium dynamics. Mining company Hut 8 will sell $500 million worth of shares. The funds will be used to expand the company’s data centre infrastructure and to purchase Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) sees the integration of AI with blockchain, tokenisation and stablecoins as key areas of development for the crypto industry in 2025. Justin Drake, one of Ethereum’s core developers, said the Solana network, touted as a “killer” of Ethereum, is not really a threat or even a direct competitor. Arkham Intelligence noted that the bankrupt Mt. Gox exchange moved 24,052 BTC ($2.47 billion) to an unknown address. This is the first major move of the exchange’s assets since 12 November, when the platform sent 2,500 BTC to two unknown addresses.

  "title": "Stock market today : World stocks are mixed ahead of a key US jobs report",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter.

Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.

  "title": "XRP And Stellar Are Popular Investors Picks In The Bull Market , But Another Rival Emerges With 50x Potential",
  "content": " Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) are two of the biggest winners that benefited from the positive reaction to Donald Trump winning the US Presidential election on November 5, 2024. While these coins became top picks among investors, a new DeFi coin has emerged to rival them with a 50x price pump potential in this bull market. This coin is related to a brokerage firm that is considered to be the best crypto trading platform. Read to find out what we know about this new DeFi coin that may challenge XRP and XLM! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE<<< XRP Approaches $3: What Is Driving Up the Ripple Coin Price? Ripple’s XRP took flight towards the tail end of November 2024, rising to $2.84 on a 373% rally. This rally pushed XRP to a price level last reached six years ago. Although XRP trades below its all-time high of $3.30, which it claimed in 2018, experts opine that the Ripple coin can cross this price point. Weighing in on the Ripple coin’s short-term outlook, B2BinPay CEO Arthur Azizov noted that the election results greatly impacted XRP’s growth. Since then, Ripple’s XRP has grown fivefold, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Robinhood recently relisted XRP, which is another factor driving its growth. If an XRP ETF appears in the picture, this could further push the value upward. The Ripple coin trades at $2.75, up 89.44% over the last seven days. Analyst Says Stellar Can Rise 20% to $0.68 in the Bull Market Javon Marks, a crypto pundit, has suggested that Stellar’s XLM might be on the verge of a 20% price rally to $0.68. Marks wrote this thesis in an X post on December 2, 2024. According to Marks, the Stellar coin has been holding and adding to gains since the bull market began. With the strength of the altcoin market still in place, XLM could push towards $0.68, a target he has foreseen for a while now. Marks added that Stellar’s XLM could move higher if the Stellar coin breaks through the $0.68 resistance. He opined that a surge to $1.20 for XLM could happen if the Stellar coin broke past the highlighted resistance. Over the last 30 days, XLM gained 450%, with its market capitalization rising to $16.1 billion. The Stellar coin currently sits at $0.55, up 11.9% in the past week.

  "title": "Top 4 Cardano Alternatives : Turning 100 USDT Into 10 , 000 USDT Fast",
  "content": " Skip to content 4 ADA Rivals That Could Turn 100 USDT Into 10,000 in 2 MonthsExplore four competitors to Cardano (ADA) with the potential to grow 100 USDT into 10,000 USDT in just two months. Learn what makes these altcoins stand out. The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities, and many are looking for alternatives to Cardano (ADA). In this article, we highlight four competitors with the potential to transform a 100 USDT deposit into 10,000 USDT in just two months. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A New Blockchain Contender The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale has achieved a huge milestone, passing 600,000 USDT in token sales! Tokens are now priced at 0.00006401 USDT, giving buyers a 70% advantage over the listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Stage 1 buyers who got in at 0.000040 USDT have already seen a ~50% boost. MTAUR stands out with its strong utility in gaming. It’s the key to unlocking special features and staying ahead. Holders also enjoy unique perks, like referral bonuses that benefit both you and your friends, and additional tokens through the vesting program. Plus, the ongoing 100,000 USDT giveaway offers an exciting chance to win big, with 50,000 USDT going to one lucky buyer! The presale is heating up, and the token pool is shrinking daily. Grab your tokens now before the price rises again. Don’t miss out! Shiba Inu (SHIB): Token Burns and Whales Fuel Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most talked-about meme coins. Recent Shiba Inu news revealed a massive burn of 2 billion tokens, increasing SHIB’s burn rate by 7,400%. This burn reduces the total supply, which could push the value of the Shiba coin higher over time. Shiba Inu coin news also highlighted whale activity, with large holders accumulating Shiba Inu coin in significant amounts. Currently, SHIB is priced at $0.00003096, up 68% this month. The Shiba Inu crypto could break through $0.00004 and target $0.0006. This combination of burns and whale support makes SHIB coin a strong contender in the market. Polygon (POL): Building Trust With Whale Activity Polygon (POL) is showing renewed momentum, thanks to increased whale transactions. Over 48 hours, POL saw transactions worth $59 million, signaling growing interest. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) also climbed back above $1 billion, showing recovery and renewed network strength. As of now, POL is priced between $0.60 and $0.70. If it breaks the $0.85 mark, it could rise to $1. With its strong developer focus and institutional support, Polygon is gaining ground as a serious competitor to Cardano ADA. Sui (SUI): A Blockchain Built for Speed What is SUI, and why is it gaining attention? Sui crypto is a blockchain known for handling up to 297,000 transactions per second, making it faster than Ethereum. This feature has scored the Sui token the nickname “Ethereum killer.” Sui USD reached an all-time high of $3.92 in November, and it could rise sevenfold again. If Bitcoin hits $150,000, the Sui price has all the chances to surge to $28. Backed by a growing ecosystem and key partnerships, Sui prediction models show it could acquire a bigger market slice in the coming months. Conclusion These four coins—MTAUR, SHIB, POL, and SUI—are worth watching closely. Shiba Inu coin is gaining strength from burns and whales, while Sui crypto is redefining blockchain speed. Among today’s top picks, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is the standout, offering jaw-dropping perks and incredible upside potential. With its low entry point, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join a project built for success. The presale is closing fast—don’t let this slip through your fingers.

  "content": " Market spotlight has now turned on the payrolls data due from the U.S. on Friday morning. Markets expect the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with conducting monetary policy to support the goals of maximum employment and stable prices to take cognizance of the price pressures emanating from the labor market. The unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 4.2 percent in November from 4.1 percent in the previous month. Markets also expect the addition to payrolls to record 200 thousand versus 12 thousand in the previous month. Average hourly earnings, another key labor market metric is expected to edge down on a monthly as well as yearly basis. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve, in its decision which is 12 days away is still expected to reduce rates. However, as shown in the CME FedWatch tool, the likelihood of a quarter-point Fed rate cut in December has decreased to 68 percent whereas the expected probability of a status quo has increased to 32 percent. Wall Street Futures are in mildly negative territory. European benchmarks are trading in the green zone. Asian benchmarks closed on a mixed note. The Dollar Index edged up.

Today's top stories Syrian opposition forces stormed Hama city in central Syria yesterday as part of their largest offensive in years against President Bashar al-Assad's government. The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Omar Albam / AP / APSmoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing. Life advice Malaka Gharib/ NPR / It is the season for giving, but not everyone has a knack for finding the right gift for their loved ones. Editor-in-chief of SELF Magazine Rachel Wilkerson Miller and actress and content creator Asia Jackson share advice on how to buy meaningful presents for five personality types. 🎁 For the practical person, consider a gift they could use in their daily lives. Miller recommends gift cards for services like oil changes, car washes and dog walking. 🎁 A gift card probably won't cut it for sentimental loved ones. Consider giving them a memento that relates to a memory you both share. Homemade gifts are also great options. 🎁 For those who enjoy experiences, consider activity-related gifts like cookbooks, Lego sets or even a membership to a local museum. 🎁 Gifts that encourage relaxation and destressing, like massage guns and blankets, are perfect for the cozy person. 🎁 What about the person who has it all? Give them something totally fun, totally unexpected and heartfelt. Get more gift ideas for these five personality types here.

  "title": "Crafting Headlines That Captivate : 19 Styles Every Writer Should Master - By Isaac Asabor",
  "content": " In the world of writing, whether for journalism, marketing, or creative storytelling, the headline is the first handshake with your audience. It is the singular moment where a reader decides whether to proceed or scroll past. Headlines serve as the gateway to the story, setting the tone, creating expectations, and, more importantly, sparking curiosity. Therefore, it is germane at this juncture to disclose that this article explores 19 headline styles that writers can leverage to command attention and achieve their objectives, while also delving deeper into the significance of crafting impactful headlines. In fact, headlines are more than just titles; they are a strategic tool in writing. Research shows that online readers spend mere seconds skimming through content, often deciding based on the headline alone whether the article is worth their time. In print, the headline competes with other stories for the reader’s focus, while in marketing, it serves as the hook to capture interest and drive conversions. A compelling headline can mean the difference between your message being heard or ignored. From a journalistic perspective, headlines must strike a balance between being informative and engaging. For instance, in breaking news, a straightforward and factual headline is crucial. On the other hand, feature articles often benefit from creativity and emotional appeal to draw readers into the narrative. Similarly, in copywriting and advertising, the headline is often the first, and sometimes the only, opportunity to make an impression. To illustrate the breadth of possibilities, here are 19 headline styles that writers can use across various subjects and genres. Firstly, the “Direct Headline” is effective for delivering the essence of a story succinctly. It is the go-to style when clarity and immediacy are essential. For example, “Scientists Discover Cure for Common Cold” leaves no ambiguity about the topic. Secondly, the “Indirect Headline” piques curiosity by hinting at the story without giving away the details. An example like “When Innovation Meets Resistance” intrigues readers to explore further. This style is particularly useful for features or opinion pieces where mystery adds value. In a similar vein, the “Breaking News Headline” emphasizes timeliness and significance. Headlines such as “Earthquake Hits California, Thousands Displaced” are crucial in news reporting, where immediacy and impact are paramount. Also, the “How-To Headline” is ideal for practical and instructional content. Headlines like “How to Create a Stunning Resume in Five Easy Steps” resonate with readers seeking solutions or learning opportunities. This style is highly effective for self-help, tutorials, and educational pieces. Still in a similar vein, the “Question Headline” engages readers by directly addressing their concerns or curiosity. An example like “What Does the Future Hold for Electric Vehicles?” invites readers to seek answers within the article. The “Command Headline” which is the sixth headline, uses an authoritative tone to compel action or interest. For instance, “Start Investing Today to Secure Your Future” directs readers toward a specific goal or idea. Seventhly, the “Reason-Why Headline” organizes information in a structured, list-based format. A headline such as “7 Reasons Why You Should Visit Iceland This Summer” appeals to readers who enjoy digestible, enumerated content. Eighthly, the “Emotional Headline” taps into human feelings to foster a connection. For example, “Heartbroken Parents Share Their Stories After School Shooting” evokes empathy and compels readers to engage with the story. Also, the “Wordplay Headline” adds a touch of creativity and humor, making even complex topics more palatable. An example like “The ‘App’-etizer Economy: How Tech Startups Are Feeding Growth” blends cleverness with relevance. Tenthly, the “Brand Name Headline” incorporates well-known names to add context or credibility. A headline such as “Apple vs. Samsung: The Battle for Smartphone Supremacy” leverages brand recognition to attract readers. Moreover, the “Best Headline” highlights the crème de la crème of any category. For instance, “The 10 Best Movies to Watch This Holiday Season” appeals to readers seeking curated recommendations. Furthermore, the “Two-Part Headline” combines two related ideas for added impact. An example like “Climate Change: A Crisis or an Opportunity?” juxtaposes contrasting perspectives to engage readers. Similarly, the “Relational Headline” personalizes the subject, making it relatable to the audience. A headline like “Here Is How to Stay Fit While Working a Desk Job” connects directly with readers’ experiences. In addition, the “Location-Specific Headline” targets a regional audience. For example, “Why Seattle is Leading the Green Energy Revolution” resonates with a geographically focused demographic. Moreover, the “Challenging Belief Headline” uses reverse psychology or unconventional statements to provoke interest. A headline like “Why Failure Might Be the Best Thing for Your Career” challenges conventional wisdom to grab attention. Additionally, the “Confrontational Headline” takes a bold stance to ignite debate. For instance, “Traditional Publishing is Dying: Here’s Why” invites readers into a discussion. Another style, the “Testimonial Headline”, uses personal stories to humanize a subject. An example such as “‘I Quit My Job and Found Happiness,’ Says Former Executive” adds authenticity to the narrative. Furthermore, the “Backed-by-Science Headline” uses data or research findings to enhance credibility. For instance, “Studies Show Meditation Reduces Anxiety by 40%” appeals to evidence-driven readers. Finally, the “Background Headline” sets the stage by providing context before diving into specifics. A headline like “The History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Blockchain” prepares readers for a detailed exploration. The strategic application of these headline styles can elevate any piece of writing, whether for news articles, blog posts, or advertisements. Headlines function as the bridge between the writer’s intent and the reader’s engagement, ensuring the message is not only seen but also understood. For professional writers, understanding the nuances of headline crafting can sharpen their skills and broaden their appeal. It is a craft that requires practice, creativity, and a deep understanding of the audience. Whether you aim to inform, persuade, or entertain, the right headline style can make your writing stand out in a crowded digital landscape. In fact, headlines are the unsung heroes of compelling communication. They are the first impression, the initial handshake, and the deciding factor in whether a piece of writing resonates. By mastering these 19 headline styles, writers can not only capture attention but also foster meaningful connections with their audience. The next time you craft a headline, let these strategies inspire your creativity and elevate your work to new heights. Post Views: 139 "

  "title": "Dave Portnoy Blames Winklevoss Twins For Confusing Him Into Selling Bitcoin Too Early",
  "content": "Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy has taken a lighthearted jab at himself and the Winklevoss twins, recounting a costly decision to sell his Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings after a perplexing conversation with the famed crypto advocates. What Happened: In a tweet, Portnoy revealed he had purchased $2 million worth of Bitcoin at $11,000 per coin in 2020, only to sell it all shortly after a discussion with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Bitcoin is now trading at $98,000, after making an all time high of $103,679 on December 12, leaving Portnoy lamenting, \"I've been chasing it ever since. Dave is sad.\" In a resurfaced video accompanying the tweet, Portnoy humorously recalls being utterly baffled by the twins' explanation of Bitcoin, particularly their claim about the potential for Elon Musk to mine gold from asteroids. \"If he mines all the gold in the asteroids above Earth, then all of a sudden gold is going to fall from the sky and be as plentiful as sand,\" the twins had explained. Also Read: Anthony Pompliano Says Countries Are ‘Going To FOMO’ Into Buying Bitcoin Reacting to their comments, Portnoy admitted in the video, “I literally have no idea what Bitcoin is,” adding that parts of their conversation sounded like jokes but were delivered with dead seriousness. His confusion led him to offload his Bitcoin holdings, a decision he now regrets as Bitcoin's price has surged nearly tenfold since then. The video captures Portnoy's struggle to grasp the concept of Bitcoin, pointing out the complexities that can come with understanding digital assets. His candid admission about selling too soon offers a relatable moment for many investors who have found themselves perplexed by cryptocurrency's nuances.

  "title": "Crypto Stocks Swing Wildly After Bitcoin Tops $100 , 000",
  "content": " Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency companies saw their shares swing after the price of Bitcoin climbed above $100,000 late Wednesday.The rally was spurred in part by President-elect Donald Trump's pick of crypto enthusiast Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.MicroStrategy and Coinbase, along with bitcoin miners Riot Platforms and Mara Holdings, were among the companies to see their shares rise and then fall today. Crypto-focused companies' shares had a volatile Thursday as bitcoin traded above $100,000 and then retreated. MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business intelligence services provider that is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw its stock rise as much as 10% intraday but finished some 4% lower. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) rose before ending the day off 3%. Other stocks that rose early and ended lower included bitcoin mining companies Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Mara Holdings (MARA). Both finished the day down more than 4%. Wednesday's news that President-elect Donald Trump picked Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission had helped drive the latest round of gains for bitcoin and other crypto assets. Atkins, an SEC Commissioner under former President George W. Bush, has worked lately on issues related to digital assets. Atkins would replace crypto critic Gary Gensler, who said he would step down in January. The promise of a more crypto-friendly administration has propelled bitcoin prices more than 50% higher since the day before Trump’s election win. Bitcoin recently traded closer to $95,000 after earlier topping $103,000. "

  "title": "Bitcoin Reaches $100 , 000 Milestone Before Slipping : What Investors Need To Know",
  "content": " Bitcoin made history on December 4 by surpassing $100,000 for the first time before sliding below the milestone less than 24 hours later. The cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a central concern for investors, even as its growing role in financial markets becomes clearer. The price of Bitcoin dramatically peaked at $103,844.05 late Wednesday but settled at around $99,140 by Thursday afternoon, according to Coin Metrics. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, called the milestone a “paradigm shift” for digital assets. “Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” he said. What fueled the rise? President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance partly buoyed Bitcoin’s surge. He nominated Paul Atkins as SEC chair, a move widely seen as favorable for the industry. Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly approach, is expected to replace Gary Gensler, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Investor sentiment also drove the rise in Bitcoin’s price. As Bitcoin climbed, it triggered a wave of short position liquidations, wiping out over $132 million in just a few hours. Its dominance in the crypto market increased to 57%, further solidifying its influence. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index climbed to a high of 94 on November 22 before settling at an “extreme greed” level of 84 after the latest rally. Social sentiment reflected the euphoria in the market, and Google Trends reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin-related searches on Thursday. Yet, experts caution against too much optimism. “It’s volatile, unpredictable, and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. The risk of corrections Bitcoin’s rapid dip below $100,000 highlights the dangers of profit-taking and market corrections. This cycle of sharp rises and sudden declines has defined Bitcoin’s history. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted, Bitcoin functions more like digital gold than a traditional currency. Despite its ups and downs, Bitcoin has gained over 133% this year and 42% since the election. These numbers attract both seasoned investors and newcomers, driven by the fear of missing out. Yet, analysts like Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of cryptocurrency Tezos, warn that markets driven by momentum require caution. While some view Bitcoin as a store of value, others remain skeptical of its ability to stabilize. The potential for regulatory changes under the incoming administration could pave the way for further adoption, but it also adds uncertainty. For now, Bitcoin’s crossing of the $100,000 threshold is a historic achievement, but its journey ahead will likely remain as volatile as ever. Investors are advised to tread carefully, keeping in mind both its immense potential and its significant risks. "

  "title": "Veteran Trader Warns Against  Aggressive Long  Positions On Bitcoin , Equities Amid Market Volatility - Invesco QQQ Trust , Series 1 ( NASDAQ : QQQ ) ",
  "content": "Seasoned trader and analyst Jason Shapiro reflected on Thursday’s sharp pullback in Bitcoin BTC/USD and the stock market, warning against going “aggressively long” on risk-on assets until year-end. What Happened: In a video posted on his official YouTube channel, Shapiro said, \"I will say something that nobody wants to say and nobody wants to hear, which is, I don’t think from now at least until year-end is a great time to be aggressively long risk assets.\" Shapiro acknowledged the record highs scaled in both markets recently but argued against going long from a risk-to-reward perspective. \"It just doesn’t feel right to me. It starts getting too easy, and when it gets too easy is when it really is going to start getting hard,\" the experienced trader shared his thoughts. See Also: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Drives MicroStrategy’s 490% Surge, Hedge Fund CIO Says It’s An ‘Extreme Example’ Of Volatility Monetization Shapiro also questioned the market’s growing consensus on a “Christmas Rally” and a subsequent retracement in the new year. \"Well, who in their right mind is going to buy it into Christmas if they think it’s going to go down into January?\" For the uninitiated, Shapiro is known for his contrarian approach, which means going short during bullish euphoria and going long during bearish sentiment. Why It Matters: Shapiro's bearish prediction comes amid a sharp retracement in both Bitcoin and Wall Street stocks. While the world's leading cryptocurrency flash crashed to nearly $92,000 after breaking beyond $100,000 just a day earlier, major averages like the S&P 500 SPY and the Nasdaq Composite QQQ snapped their record-breaking streak by falling 0.19% and 0.17%, respectively. According to TradingView, Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, was 6 at the time of writing. This implied that investment in the cryptocurrency was generating positive returns above the risk-free rate. Similarly, the S&P 500's Sharpe Ratio showed a reading of 1.13, indicating a better risk-adjusted return potential. Price Action: As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $97,678.87, pulling back 4.85% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The S&P 500 dropped 0.19% to end at 6,075.11 during Thursday's regular session.

Figures are based on current internal estimates and exclude REC purchases.Hardware profit margin for Bitcoin mining and AI Cloud Services is calculated as revenue less net electricity costs, divided by revenue (for each respective revenue stream) and excludes all other costs.All-in cash cost per Bitcoin at 31 EH/s reflects total net electricity costs, overheads and Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) cash costs and includes benefit of $32m illustrative contribution from AI Cloud Services, on a per Bitcoin mined basis. Calculations assume hardware operates at 100% uptime, nameplate fleet efficiency of 15 J/TH, weighted average power cost of $0.036, overheads of $81m, REC costs of $9m, power consumption of 484MW, network hashrate of 732 EH/s, block reward of 3.125 BTC per block, transaction fees of 0.1 BTC per block, pool fees of 0.15%. $32m illustrative contribution from AI Cloud Services calculated as illustrative revenue less assumed electricity costs (excludes all other site, overhead and REC costs) and assumes hardware is fully utilized by customers and operating at 100% uptime, 1.25kW power draw per GPU, $0.045/kWh electricity costs and $2.00 per GPU hour revenue assumption.

  "title": "Ethereum To Pull A BTC 2021 - Like Rally ? Analyst Weighs In",
  "content": " As Bitcoin finally soars above the long-awaited $100,000 milestone, Ethereum (ETH) attempts to break out from a key resistance zone. The second-largest crypto rally has fueled optimism about its targets, with some suggesting that it could mimic BTC’s 2020-2021 rally. Ethereum Reclaims $3,900 Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recorded a 10% surge in the past week, moving from the $3,500 mark to the $3,900 resistance. On Wednesday, the King of Altcoins surpassed the $3,800 level for the first time in six months and continued climbing to retest the $3,900 resistance, not seen since early March. In the early hours of Thursday, ETH turned this key zone into support, briefly dipping to $3,860 before jumping back to the recently reclaimed level. As the cryptocurrency nears its yearly high of $4,093, sentiment around the token’s short-term performance has turned extremely bullish. Ethereum is retesting a massive multi-year resistance zone, which could send ETH to a new ATH. According to analyst Alex Clay, the cryptocurrency attempts to break “through the Key Resistance Zone on the weekly timeframe.” ETH has rested the key zone five times since 2021, facing rejection from the upper resistance at $3,950 on four occasions before. However, Ethereum broke past this level in late 2021, when it hit its all-time high (ATH) and held above it for nearly three months. The analyst noted that if the King of Altcoins successfully breaks above this level and turns it into support, it will be the next “to break through” and smash its ATH. Clay added that he sees “no major pullback in the near time.” Similarly, crypto analyst Jelle stated that if Ethereum breaks above the March high, “all bets are off,” suggesting that the chances of ETH taking a long consolidation period before a new ATH like BTC did were “very low.” ETH To Rally Toward $10,000? Jelle also noted that Ethereum’s current setup mimicked Bitcoin’s in July 2020. Per the chart, Bitcoin broke through a multi-year downtrend line by mid-2020, followed by a massive 500% 10-month rally toward the $60,000 mark in April 2021. ETH’s setup resembles Bitcoin’s 2020-2021 chart. Source: Crypto Jelle on X The analyst noted that ETH breached the multi-year trendline today, like BTC in 2020, which could trigger a similar rally toward new highs in the next few months. He added that investors are “in for a treat if this plays out anything similar.” In another post, he highlighted that Ethereum started rallying when Bitcoin broke its ATH and entered price discovery when BTC traded nearly 100% above its previous cycle high. He considers that it would be surprising to “see things play out similarly this time around. BTC & ETH climbing in tandem, leading to ETH entering price discovery somewhere around ±$130,000.” Based on this, the analyst believes that a 150-200% rally toward the $10,000-$12,000 price range for the cryptocurrency is possible for this cycle. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,905, a 2.4% increase in the daily timeframe. Ethereum’s performance in the weekly chart.

Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

  "title": "The Logic Behind Bitcoin Power Law",
  "content": "Price of BTC GraphKorok Ray A few years back, a European researcher released a power law model to fit Bitcoin's price behavior over time. The basic idea is that power laws are useful for describing a wide variety of phenomena in nature and science. Formerly, the power law fitted to Bitcoin is a simple equation Price = A(t - t_0)^n Here t is time, t_0 is initial time, A is a scaling factor, and n is an exponent. Put simply, the price of Bitcoin is a function of the amount of time that has passed since its inception. This relationship can be seen most visually by taking the logarithm of both sides. If you do that, you will arrive at log⁡Price = log⁡A + n log⁡(t - t_0) Then, you can fit a linear regression to log price against log time. My data runs from 2011, and you'll see that there is a very clear linear trend in the log-log space. This differs from my previous analysis, where I had used and plotted log price against time. Here, I'm plotting the log price against log time. The full article on the power law theory by its author is a deeper exposition of why power laws work in nature. Most of that essay is worth reading, though I will disagree on one point. The author claims that the power law has nothing to do with scarcity, since it is a statistical fit to a price chart. However, scarcity is the foundation of Bitcoin's value proposition and is exactly why new buyers continue to enter the market. But why? My explanation for why the power law theory fits is the cycle of FOMO. Because Bitcoin is provably scarce, new adopters will always know that the limited supply will keep the price higher in the future and will not lead to a collapse in price, as can happen in other assets like gold. Gold miners can increase their production if the price of gold rises. Therefore, new gold miners shift the supply curve of gold production forward, leading to a decrease in the price of gold since more gold could be mined. Bitcoin miners have no ability to change the issuance of new bitcoins, since that is determined by the protocol. Bitcoin miners can only contribute new hash power to the network, which increases their own chance of earning the block reward. However, they have no market-wide impact on price, unlike gold miners. New buyers of Bitcoin, therefore, know that there will always be other buyers coming in after them who will face the same decision problem, just later in time. Except that those buyers will have even fewer coins available. So, it is optimal to enter the market once you learn of this provable scarcity. At any point in time, there will always be someone before you who bought earlier when there were more bitcoins available at a lower price, and also that there will always also be someone after you who will buy when there are fewer Bitcoins available at a higher price. This cycle is ultimately what drives the upward trajectory in price. No other cryptocurrency has this unique feature. There are, of course, shocks to the system, like the FTX collapse, Mount Gox, the Silk Road, and the China crackdown on Bitcoin mining. Those are the deviations around the trend line. But the chief principle here is the continuing spread of knowledge about Bitcoin across the population. Will this ever stop? Once Bitcoin adoption penetrates the entire world then there is no guarantee that the FOMO cycle will continue. At that time, price will stabilize and volatility will decrease, as befits a widely held asset. But we are far from that point, and so I do believe there is some truth behind the power law graph. It would be intellectually dishonest to admit that price has no impact on Bitcoin adoption. An honest assessment of human behavior is that price is all that matters. The provable scarcity of Bitcoin ensures that new buyers will enter the market. I'm not even sure that Satoshi knew about this fundamental feature of Bitcoin's scarcity, as the supply cap is not even mentioned in the white paper. But as the power law shows, something is driving this behavior. Provable scarcity. "

  "content": "Home » Business » Bitcoin at $100,000: Milestone likely to boost Indian investors' rush The recent Bitcoin rally, which saw the cryptocurrency surge past the $100,000 mark on Thursday, is drawing Indian investors in droves. Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters Cryptocurrency platforms in India are experiencing a significant uptick in activity and user sign-ups, driven by the optimism surrounding “crypto-friendly” Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. “We’ve seen a five to six times increase in trading volume on our platform,” says Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch, a major crypto exchange. “Every metric — from new customer acquisition to people visiting the platform, people trading on our platform, and the trading volume — has surged, with some metrics climbing by as much as ten times.” With rise in the VDA’s (virtual digital asset’s) value, more investors are turning to it as a feasible investment opportunity. Trump’s appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who had cracked down on digital assets following the 2022 market crash, is expected to further fuel the rally. Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, a leading crypto exchange, notes the increase in user registrations. “We’re seeing a five to six times expansion in new user sign-ups. \"Trading volumes have increased by over 300 per cent due to the growing interest in this rally,” Gupta explains. Founders of crypto firms anticipate the rally will continue through the first half of 2025, supported by a steady influx of new users. “We’re seeing a lot of old users coming back, checking their portfolio, and either buying or selling some of it. \"These are known as reactivations. Also, I expect that a lot of new users will come in over the next few months,” said Edul Patel, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Mudrex. For the second consecutive year, India has continued to lead the way in global cryptocurrency adoption in 2024, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. At present, India has around 40 million active crypto investors, suggest industry estimates. Indian investors are now viewing Bitcoin as a viable option for wealth creation, said Thangapandi Durai, CEO, Koinpark. “For Indian investors, this (the $100,000 milestone) is a prime opportunity to recognise that cryptocurrencies offer substantial capital appreciation potential. \"Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ provides a hedge against inflation while serving as a store of value.” Some experts warn investors to approach cryptocurrencies with caution due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintains its cautious stance, warning that cryptocurrencies pose risks to the financial and monetary stability of the country. \"Investors should conduct proper research and not view cryptos as a shortcut to 50x or 100x returns within months. \"A disciplined, long-term approach is necessary,” advised Purvang Mashru, senior quantitative research analyst at 1 Finance.

  "title": "5 Best Coins to Invest in This Month : Get Ahead of the Crowd",
  "content": " The cryptocurrency market never sleeps, and each month brings new opportunities to shake up your portfolio. December is no different, with fresh trends, innovative projects, and tokens poised for explosive growth. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or someone looking to dip your toes in, getting ahead of the crowd is key. Among the top contenders this month is Qubetics ($TICS), a Web3 aggregator that’s making waves with its presale success and innovative approach to real-world blockchain applications. Let’s dive into five of the best coins to invest in this month and why these tokens deserve a spot in your portfolio. 1. Qubetics: The Star of the Month Imagine owning a piece of real estate or art worth millions—tokenised into bite-sized digital assets you can trade like stocks. That’s the magic of Qubetics’ Asset Tokenisation platform. It takes physical and digital assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, turns them into tradable tokens, and makes them accessible to everyone. With Qubetics, decentralised finance isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a transformative tool for investors from all walks of life. Imagine Jane, a small business owner in Ohio, tokenising her café property to raise capital, or Sam, a 20-something crypto enthusiast in New York, diversifying his portfolio with tokenised gold. Qubetics makes these scenarios possible through advanced features like Cosmos SDK, post-quantum cryptography, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance to ensure security and reliability. The buzz around Qubetics is more than hype. With over $4.4 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.0282 per token, early investors are looking at a jaw-dropping ROI of 783% by the end of the presale. If you invest $10,000 now, you could turn that into $78,300—or potentially $150,000 if the post-presale $5 target hits. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just a project; it’s a revolution in blockchain adoption. With predictions as high as $15 after its mainnet launch, this is one of the best coins to invest in this month. 2. Kaspa (KAS): The Speed Demon Kaspa is a high-speed Layer-1 blockchain that has solved the infamous blockchain trilemma: security, decentralisation, and scalability. With block intervals of just one second, it’s the fastest proof-of-work chain out there. Its simplicity appeals to developers, while its speed makes it a favourite for traders. In recent weeks, Kaspa has gained attention for its growing dApp ecosystem and upcoming updates designed to optimise mining efficiency. Analysts predict its price could double by Q1 2025. A $10,000 investment in KAS now could set you up with a significant profit within months. Why did this coin make it to this list? Kaspa’s unmatched speed and scalability make it a strong contender for December, especially with developers flocking to build on its network. 3. Stacks (STX): Bringing Bitcoin to Smart Contracts Stacks bridges the gap between Bitcoin and smart contracts, allowing developers to build dApps on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its Clarity programming language ensures security and simplicity, which has attracted projects ranging from DeFi platforms to NFTs. Stacks’ recent collaboration with major DeFi players hints at a bullish future. Experts believe its price could hit a new high by mid-2025. Your $10,000 investment today could turn into massive gains if those predictions hold. Why did this coin make it to this list? Stacks’ unique proposition of empowering Bitcoin with smart contracts makes it an undeniable pick this month. 4. Quant (QNT): The Interoperability King Quant is revolutionising the blockchain landscape with its focus on seamless connectivity. At the heart of its innovation is Overledger, a groundbreaking technology that allows different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. This solution bridges gaps in the fragmented blockchain ecosystem, making Quant a key player for enterprise-level adoption. From enhancing efficiency in healthcare systems to streamlining banking operations, Quant’s utility extends across industries. It’s not just about crypto enthusiasts anymore—major institutions are taking notice. The ability to integrate blockchain technology into existing systems without the usual complexity makes Quant an indispensable tool for enterprises worldwide. Why did this coin make it to this list? Quant’s enterprise-grade solutions position it as a long-term winner, with strong momentum this month. 5. Aptos (APT): The Solana Rival Aptos has earned its reputation as a game-changing blockchain, often referred to as the “Solana killer” for its impressive speed and innovation. Its architecture prioritises scalability, security, and efficiency, making it a magnet for developers seeking a robust platform to build decentralised applications (dApps). The blockchain’s recent mainnet upgrade has further solidified its position as a leader in the space, addressing scalability challenges while maintaining a high level of security. This combination of performance and reliability has attracted a thriving ecosystem of projects, from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms, making Aptos a significant force in the crypto world. Why did this coin make it to this list? Aptos’ advanced technology and rapidly expanding ecosystem make it a standout contender, offering a glimpse into the future of blockchain innovation. Conclusion Ready to pivot to one of the best coins to invest in this month? The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities this December, and these five tokens stand out as the cream of the crop. From Qubetics’ game-changing asset tokenisation to Kaspa’s blazing speed, there’s something for every kind of investor here. But let’s be honest: Qubetics is the one coin you can’t afford to overlook. With its presale nearing a price hike, now is the time to jump in. Don’t miss your chance to ride the $TICS wave—your financial future might just thank you.

  "content": "U.S. stocks could open in the red on Friday as investors exercise caution and take a break after pushing the Dow past 45,000 for the first time. Futures of all three major indices were marginally down on Friday, pointing to cautious sentiment on Wall Street. Investors remain tentative on equities ahead of the crucial payroll data that is set to be released later today. Also playing on investors' minds are Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's comments about the U.S. economy's strength. \"The labor market is better, and the downside risks appear to be less in the labor market. Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming [out] a little higher,\" Powell said during an interview at the New York Times' DealBook Summit on Wednesday. However, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows that expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December stand at 66.7%, up from 66% a week ago. FuturesPerformance (+/-)Nasdaq 100-0.03%S&P 500-0.08%Dow Jones-0.04%R2K0.09% In premarket trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY fell 0.02% to $606.51 and the Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ remained flat at $521.83, according to Benzinga Pro data. Cues From Last Session: U.S. stocks closed on a negative note on Thursday, with all three major indices registering declines. The Dow Jones closed below 45,000 after scaling the mark for the first time on Wednesday. Crude oil prices fell on Friday after OPEC+ announced its decision to delay an increase in its production output. Treasury yields edged up slightly ahead of the payrolls data release. On the economic data front, U.S. initial jobless claims increased to 224,000 in the week ending Nov. 30, compared to 213,000 in the previous week, and higher than market estimates of 215,000. The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $73.8 billion in October versus a revised $83.8 billion gap in the previous month and compared to market estimates of a $75 billion gap. Most sectors on the S&P 500 closed on a negative note, with industrials, materials, and healthcare stocks recording the biggest losses on Thursday. However, consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks bucked the overall market trend, closing the session higher.

He added that the S&P 500 hitting the 6,300 level by the end of the year is \"very doable.\" At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,062, down 4.43% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro data. On the other hand, Sonu Varghese, Vice President, Global Macro Strategist at Carson Group, flagged a Fed policy error as a \"big risk for 2025.\" Varghese's warning comes after Powell's comments about rate cuts earlier this week signaled that the Fed chair is willing to be patient, instead of rushing through with the cuts as earlier thought. He thinks that stubborn inflation could force the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to be more cautious with stepping on the rate cut pedal. Varghese anticipates that elevated inflation could result in no rate cuts for as long as the first half of 2025. \"Ultimately, if the Fed does pause for an extended period of time, that's going to be on the back of spurious, backward-looking inflation data, rather than what's happening in reality.\" \"Meanwhile, policy would implicitly be getting tighter, as policy rates stay elevated and underlying inflation remains muted. That's a big risk for cyclical sectors of the economy,\" he added. See Also: How To Trade Futures Upcoming Economic Data Friday's economic calendar consists of some crucial data releases. The U.S. employment report, U.S. unemployment rate, and U.S. hourly wage data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. The preliminary data for consumer sentiment will be released at 10 a.m. ET. Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will speak at 10:30 a.m., ET. Consumer credit data will be released at 3:00 p.m. ET. Stocks In Focus: Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU stock surged over 8% in premarket trading on Friday after the company beat analyst estimates with its third-quarter earnings. Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA stock surged over 11% in premarket after the company beat estimates and raised its fiscal year forecast. DocuSign Inc. DOCU stock gained 15% in premarket after the company's earnings edged past estimates and revised its guidance for the fiscal year. Asana Inc. ASAN stock skyrocketed 24% in premarket after the company swung back to profitability and beat analyst expectations. Investors are awaiting earnings results from Genesco Inc. GCO, BRP Inc. DOOO, and Kirkland’s, Inc. KIRK today. Commodities, Bonds And Global Equity Markets: Crude oil futures fell in the early New York session, falling 0.56% to hover around $67.92 per barrel.

  "title": "Trump Trade Policies Pose Greater Risk To South Korea Economy Than Domestic Martial Law Crisis , Says Central Bank Chief :  A Lot More Uncertainty  ",
  "content": "The governor of the Bank of Korea, Rhee Chang-yong, expressed that the South Korean economy is more threatened by the trade policies of President-elect Donald Trump than the current political crisis in the country. What Happened: Rhee Chang-yong has indicated that the fallout from President Yoon Suk Yeol’s unsuccessful attempt to impose martial law this week will postpone “critical structural reforms” to the South Korean economy and financial markets, reported the Financial Times on Thursday. However, he is of the opinion that the economic impact of this political crisis will be “limited” in comparison to the potential repercussions for Korean exporters due to the rise in Chinese competition and the anticipated heavy tariffs from Trump on the US’s leading trade partners. Rhee stated, “There is a lot of uncertainty. But compared with domestic factors, the external factors are giving us a lot more uncertainty at the moment.” He pointed out Trump’s tariff threat as one of the primary reasons for downgrading South Korea’s growth forecast for this year and the next. See Also: Fed Chair Powell: Bitcoin Is ‘Like Gold, It’s Just Virtual And Digital’ Why It Matters: South Korea’s economy, the fourth largest in Asia, was already struggling with weak domestic demand, high household debt, and increased competition from Chinese exporters. Last week, the central bank unexpectedly reduced interest rates, with Rhee expressing concerns over Trump’s victory and Republican gains in the U.S. Despite the political unrest, investors have remained relatively calm. The country’s Kospi stock benchmark was down 6% by the close of trading on Thursday from Tuesday’s close. Rhee attributed “swift and comprehensive prevention measures” to quickly calming and stabilizing the financial market. Trump’s trade policies have been a cause for concern not only in South Korea but also in other countries. A Goldman Sachs report warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs could lead to significant economic costs, particularly for Canada and Mexico. The report estimated that the GDP of these countries could shrink by as much as 4% under Trump’s full 25% tariff proposal. Analysts have also raised concerns about the potential repercussions of Trump’s tariffs on the U.S. economy, including the defense sector. A senior adviser from Beijing warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods could severely affect American manufacturers, potentially reducing U.S. GDP growth by half.

  "title": "Dow Jones Today : Stock Futures Flat as Investors Await Release of Monthly Jobs Report",
  "content": " Stocks rose Friday morning after closely watched employment data came in largely as expected, reinforcing investor confidence in the strength of the economy and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recently were up 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively, after hitting new all-time highs this morning, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, giving back earlier gains. Stocks are coming off a down session on Thursday, when the equities market hit the pause button on a post-election rally that has pushed major indexes to a series of record highs. The Labor Department's jobs report for November showed that employers added 227,000 jobs in November, a big jump from the previous month but only slightly higher than the number economists had anticipated, while the unemployment rate was in line with expectations at 4.2%. The employment numbers are among the last key pieces of data before the Fed's next interest rate decision, which is scheduled for Dec. 18. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is sensitive to expectations about where interest rates are headed, were at 4.16% recently, down from 4.18% just before the release of the employment data. Markets are now pricing in a near-90% chance the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point this month, down from the 70% likelihood priced in yesterday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Among noteworthy stocks on the move Friday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares were up 10% after the serve maker reported better-than-expected quarterly results, buoyed by strong AI demand. Shares of Lululemon (LULU) gained 18% after the maker of athletic apparel reported strong earnings and raised its outlook. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Docusign (DOCU) were up 9% and 24%, respectively, after reporting earnings. Shares of large-cap technology stocks were mostly higher, led by gains of around 2% for Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META). Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also rose, while AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly 2%. Bitcoin was trading at $99,300, little changed from late yesterday but down from a record high of near $104,000 earlier Thursday. The digital currency has gained nearly 40% since the presidential election amid investor hopes that a Trump White House and supportive Congress will adopt measures that benefit the crypto industry. Gold futures were up slightly at $2,660 an ounce, while crude oil futures rose about 1.5%. Amazon Price Levels to Watch as Stock Hits Record Highs 4 minutes ago Amazon (AMZN) shares hit another record high Friday morning, boosting their year-to-date gain to 48%. Among news developments supporting the strong performance, the tech giant said Tuesday it’s building a supercomputer using its in-house Trainium chips, which will be be used by AI start-up Anthropic. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the move positions the company to take on AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) in the lucrative graphics processing unit (GPU) chip market. Separately this week, the e-commerce titan reported record sales and number of items sold at the start of the holiday shopping season, with the company saying the majority of sales came from independent sellers. Amazon's gains so far in 2024 have handily outpaced the S&P 500’s return of about 28% over the period. The stock was up 2% to $225 in recent trading. After breaking out from an ascending triangle last month, Amazon shares retested the initial breakout area before moving higher, signaling a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Source: TradingView.com. The measuring principle, which calculates the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines and adds that amount to the pattern’s breakout area, forecasts an upside target in the stock of $250. Investors should watch major support levels on Amazon's chart around $200, $190, and $175.

The company reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 profit of $62.4 million, or $0.30 per share, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha projected $30.2 million, or $0.14 per share. Revenue of $754.8 million also beat estimates. CEO Allan Thygesen said Docusign had \"sustained momentum in new customer growth at 11% year-over-year to 1.6 million customers.\" The company now sees full-year revenue of $2.959 billion to $2.963 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $2.940 billion to $2.952 billion. TradingView Docusign shares were up 22% in recent trading, at their highest level since April 2022. -Bill McColl Ulta Beauty Levels to Watch After Post-Earnings Surge 2 hr 9 min ago Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares traded sharply higher in premarket trading Friday after the cosmetics retailer surpassed Wall Street’s earnings expectations and raised its outlook. The stock sits poised to break above the upper trendline of an ascending triangle after the company’s upbeat quarterly results, setting the stage for a potential upside reversal.

  "content": " Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverageLeveraged XRP bulls could face a “bloodbath” if Bitcoin dominance starts to rise again, says Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal. “The real danger right now for highly leveraged XRP bulls is that Bitcoin dominance increases again,” Hundal said in a recent interview with CoinTelegraph. “A rotation from XRP to Bitcoin would very likely lead to a bloodbath of liquidations.” “Thirst For Leveraged Long XRP Exposure” Could Put Traders At Risk XRP has soared over 43% in the last week to trade at $2.33 as of 2:28 a.m. EST, but is down more than 19% since reaching a weekly high of $2,9092 on Dec. 3, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance has dropped over 4% in the last week and more than 8% in the last 30 days to stand at 55.37%. Despite the drop in XRP’s price in the last couple of days, Hundal noted that there is still a “thirst for leveraged long XRP exposure.” The analyst added that XRP longs were “reloaded” even as prices dropped since the Dec. 3 peak. Retail traders have also engaged in “quick twitch buying” in the last few weeks, the analyst said, causing open interest in the market to soar to almost double the levels seen in 2021. Hundal concluded that the market might be approaching “euphoria territory.” Bitcoin Wipes Out $303 Million In Long Positions On Dec. 5, Bitcoin wiped out $300 million in long positions after a more than 5% drop to below $93K within minutes.

  "content": "Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:1. Record slipStocks moved lower Thursday, retreating from the records the major indexes hit in the previous trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 248.33 points, or 0.55%, while, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.18% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.19%.

Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIt's the first Friday of December, which means it's time for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report. Investors will be watching to see if the jobs report gives a clearer picture of the labor market after a month that was muted by strikes and storms. Friday's report is expected to show an increase of 214,000 jobs in November, which would be a significant jump from October's underwhelming 12,000 gain. It will also give the Federal Reserve a sign of the economy ahead of its next policy meeting.3.

Photographer: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Ulta and Lululemon popped after the companies reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Ulta also raised its full-year outlook slightly as the beauty retailer shook off fears that the company was facing increasing competition and slowing demand for makeup and skincare. Lululemon, meanwhile, offered holiday guidance that was in line with expectations as the yoga pants retailer expressed some caution with the company's fourth quarter outlook.4.

  "title": "Bitcoin Price Drops , Lawrence Summers Calls BTC Reserve Crazy",
  "content": " Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverageThe Bitcoin price slipped over 3% in the last 24 hours to trade at $98,661.54 as of 3:44 a.m. EST. The correction in the BTC price comes as former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers dismissed incoming President Donald Trump’s plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve as “crazy.” “Some of what is being said, this idea that we should have some kind of national Bitcoin reserve, is crazy,” Summers said during a Dec. 6 interview with Bloomberg TV. BTC also experienced a turbulent trading day yesterday as investors celebrated a new all-time high of $103,583.91 for the crypto leader. But the euphoria didn’t last long as BTC suffered a quick and sharp correction to below $93K, wiping out $200 billion from its market cap in the process. It has since bounced back to trade at its current price. Bitcoin Price Could Break Out Above A Consolidation Channel Soon 4-hour chart for BTC/USDT (Source: TradingView) The Bitcoin price has been in a consolidation phase between $93,362.62 and $99,186.57 for the majority of the last few days. During this period, it has broken both below and above the sideways range, but each break out of the consolidation channel did not last long. Now, BTC is attempting another challenge at the upper boundary of the channel at $99,186.57. Should the leading crypto break above this barrier in the next few hours, BTC might rise to as high as $103,845.17 in the short term. However, a rejection from the $99,186.57 threshold might lead to a retest of the $93,362.62 support. A drop below this technical safety net could then result in the Bitcoin price dropping to the subsequent mark at $86,839.80. Technicals Suggest Bears Are Losing Their Grip On The Bitcoin Price From a technical perspective, BTC seems to have entered into a negative cycle in the last 12 hours. However, there are signs that bulls are starting to make a comeback. Throughout the last trading day, the MACD line crossed below the MACD Signal line. This specific technical event is often interpreted as an indication that a crypto has entered a bearish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also currently positioned below its Simple Moving Average (SMA) line on the 4-hour chart. This could suggest that sellers currently have the upper hand against buyers. However, the RSI line has started to rise in recent hours and is still positively sloped. The gap between the RSI and SMA lines is also starting to narrow, which could lead to bulls stealing back the advantage from their bearish counterparts. While traders try to push the Bitcoin price back above $100K, investors are rushing to buy new meme coin and PEPE spinoff Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) for potential parabolic gains. A Meme Coin On A Mission To Level The Playing Field For Retail Traders Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is a new meme coin project that is on a mission to empower retail traders.

  "content": " Stocks slipped from their records as investors await Friday's jobs report. President-elect Donald Trump tapped David Sacks to be an AI and crypto \"czar.\" Shares of Ulta and Lululemon rose after the retailers reported earnings beats. Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day: 1. Record slip Stocks moved lower Thursday, retreating from the records the major indexes hit in the previous trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 248.33 points, or 0.55%, while, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.18% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.19%. Bitcoin, meanwhile, also traded a bit lower, falling below $100,000 after it climbed above that threshold for the first time late Wednesday. Follow live market updates. 2. Jobs time Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHiring signage displayed at a job and resource fair hosted by the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board in partnership with NCWorks in Hendersonville, North Carolina, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. It's the first Friday of December, which means it's time for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report. Investors will be watching to see if the jobs report gives a clearer picture of the labor market after a month that was muted by strikes and storms. Friday's report is expected to show an increase of 214,000 jobs in November, which would be a significant jump from October's underwhelming 12,000 gain. It will also give the Federal Reserve a sign of the economy ahead of its next policy meeting. Money Report 3. Retail rallies Shares of Ulta and Lululemon popped after the companies reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Ulta also raised its full-year outlook slightly as the beauty retailer shook off fears that the company was facing increasing competition and slowing demand for makeup and skincare. Lululemon, meanwhile, offered holiday guidance that was in line with expectations as the yoga pants retailer expressed some caution with the company's fourth quarter outlook. 4.

  "title": "Liquidations in Bitcoin , Altcoins Cooling Off",
  "content": "Market Picture The crypto market cap has shrunk to $3.6 trillion, down around 2% in the last 24 hours. The main volatility has been in Bitcoin, with Ethereum affected to a lesser extent and a barely noticeable ripple at the altcoin level. This is a strong signal of a short-term shakeout but not a change in sentiment. Thursday’s US session saw a strong wave of profit-taking, which quickly turned into a liquidation of marginal long positions. Both bullish and bearish liquidation created a swing range of almost 13% in less than 24 hours. At its lowest point, the price of Bitcoin was down to $91,000. By early European trading, it had stabilised just below $98,000, back to where it started the day on Thursday. Other stars of recent flights are also cooling off. Tron has stabilised around $0.32, roughly in the middle of this week’s range. XRP is cooling off, pulling back to $2.30, which is near the 76.4% level from the early November lows. News Background There is a strong correlation between Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000 and Tether’s increased supply of USDT stablecoin, said CEO Paolo Ardoino. Over the past 20 days, the stablecoin’s capitalisation has increased by approximately $16 billion. CryptoQuant identified significant institutional demand from US investors based on Coinbase’s premium dynamics. Mining company Hut 8 will sell $500 million worth of shares. The funds will be used to expand the company’s data centre infrastructure and to purchase Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) sees the integration of AI with blockchain, tokenisation and stablecoins as key areas of development for the crypto industry in 2025. Justin Drake, one of Ethereum’s core developers, said the Solana network, touted as a “killer” of Ethereum, is not really a threat or even a direct competitor. Arkham Intelligence noted that the bankrupt Mt. Gox exchange moved 24,052 BTC ($2.47 billion) to an unknown address. This is the first major move of the exchange’s assets since 12 November, when the platform sent 2,500 BTC to two unknown addresses.

The Significance of Analyst Ratings Explained Benzinga tracks 150 analyst firms and reports on their stock expectations. Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are. Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update. Analysts may supplement their ratings with predictions for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue, offering investors a more comprehensive outlook. However, investors should be mindful that analysts, like any human, can have subjective perspectives influencing their forecasts.

  "title": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens",
  "content": " Economists expect the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the November jobs report to show a rebound in employment levels; U.S. stock futures are little changed as indexes pulled back from record highs; Lululemon (LULU) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the retailer reported strong revenue growth and raised its sales forecast; President-elect Donald Trump appoints venture capitalist and podcaster David Sacks to be \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar\"; and Docusign (DOCU) stock surges after the company's quarterly profit more than doubled expectations. Here's what investors need to know today. 1. November Jobs Report Expected to Show Hiring Rebound Investors will be closely watching today's 8:30 a.m. ET release of the November jobs report, with forecasters projecting employment to bounce back from a storm-related dip in October. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires expect the November report to show that employers added 214,000 jobs, rebounding from 12,000 new positions the prior month, when storm damage and labor disruptions likely limited job creation. The data comes as Federal Reserve officials are closely watching economic indicators ahead of a Dec. 18 interest rate decision. 2. US Stock Futures Flat Ahead of Jobs Report U.S. stock futures are little changed ahead of the jobs report after major indexes retreated from record highs in the prior session. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is trading up 1% at around $98,000 after the cryptocurrency pulled back yesterday after crossing the $100,000 threshold for the first time Wednesday night. Crude futures are about 1% lower, gold futures are up about 0.5%, and 10-year Treasury yields are flat, hovering below 4.2%. 3. Lululemon Stock Jumps on Revenue Growth, Improved Outlook Lululemon Athletica (LULU) stock is surging 9% in premarket trading after the retailer's third-quarter results topped estimates and it raised its full-year outlook. The apparel maker reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth to $2.40 billion, above the consensus of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Net income was $351.9 million, or $2.87 per share, also above expectations. Lululemon also raised its full-year revenue forecast to $10.452 billion and $10.487 billion, up from a prior range of $10.375 billion to $10.475 billion. 4. Trump Appoints VC Investor David Sacks for White House AI, Crypto Role President-elect Donald Trump appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" saying on his Truth Social platform that Sacks will \"guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.\" Sacks, co-host of the \"All-In\" podcast, is a close friend of Trump ally and Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk, and has been a proponent of looser regulation on both cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI), according to The New York Times. 5. Docusign Stock Jumps After Earnings More Than Double Expectations Docusign (DOCU) stock is surging 12% in premarket trading after the e-signature and document management company reported third-quarter profit that more than doubled expectations. Docusign posted profit of $62.4 million, or $0.30 per share, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha projected $30.2 million, or $0.14 per share. The firm's Q3 revenue of $754.8 million also was better than the estimated $745.3 million. "

While these coins became top picks among investors, a new DeFi coin has emerged to rival them with a 50x price pump potential in this bull market. This coin is related to a brokerage firm that is considered to be the best crypto trading platform. Read to find out what we know about this new DeFi coin that may challenge XRP and XLM! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE<<< XRP Approaches $3: What Is Driving Up the Ripple Coin Price? Ripple’s XRP took flight towards the tail end of November 2024, rising to $2.84 on a 373% rally. This rally pushed XRP to a price level last reached six years ago. Although XRP trades below its all-time high of $3.30, which it claimed in 2018, experts opine that the Ripple coin can cross this price point. Weighing in on the Ripple coin’s short-term outlook, B2BinPay CEO Arthur Azizov noted that the election results greatly impacted XRP’s growth. Since then, Ripple’s XRP has grown fivefold, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Robinhood recently relisted XRP, which is another factor driving its growth. If an XRP ETF appears in the picture, this could further push the value upward. The Ripple coin trades at $2.75, up 89.44% over the last seven days. Analyst Says Stellar Can Rise 20% to $0.68 in the Bull Market Javon Marks, a crypto pundit, has suggested that Stellar’s XLM might be on the verge of a 20% price rally to $0.68. Marks wrote this thesis in an X post on December 2, 2024. According to Marks, the Stellar coin has been holding and adding to gains since the bull market began. With the strength of the altcoin market still in place, XLM could push towards $0.68, a target he has foreseen for a while now. Marks added that Stellar’s XLM could move higher if the Stellar coin breaks through the $0.68 resistance. He opined that a surge to $1.20 for XLM could happen if the Stellar coin broke past the highlighted resistance. Over the last 30 days, XLM gained 450%, with its market capitalization rising to $16.1 billion. The Stellar coin currently sits at $0.55, up 11.9% in the past week.

  "title": "France far - right and left - wing lawmakers joined together",
  "content": " France's far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes that forced Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet members to resign, a first since 1962. The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. President Emmanuel Macron insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027. However, he will need to appoint a new prime minister for the second time after July's legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament. A conservative appointed in September, Barnier becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern Republic. \"I can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,\" Barnier said in his final speech before the vote. The National Assembly is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. Barnier was accused of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens' needs. South Korea's president shocked the country on Tuesday night (Dec. 3) when, out of the blue, he declared martial law in the Asian country for the first time in nearly 50 years. Yoon Suk Yeol's drastic decision - announced in a late-night TV broadcast - mentioned \"anti-state forces\" and the threat from North Korea. But it soon became clear that it had not been spurred by external threats but by his own desperate political troubles. Still, it prompted thousands of people to gather at parliament in protest, while opposition lawmakers rushed there to push through an emergency vote to remove the measure. Defeated, Yoon emerged a few hours later to accept the parliament's vote and lift the martial law order. Now, lawmakers will vote on whether to impeach him over what the country's main opposition has called his \"insurrectionary behaviour\". His shock declaration is now being seen as a bid to get the kind of grip on power that has eluded him since he won the presidency in 2022. Syrian rebels encircled the key central city of Hama \"from three sides\", a war monitor said, despite a counteroffensive launched by government forces to retain control of the city. Hama is strategically located in central Syria and, for the army of Bashar al-Assad, is crucial to safeguarding the capital and seat of power, Damascus. The fighting around Hama follows a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels who in a matter of days wrested swathes of territory, most significantly Syria's second city, Aleppo, from the president's grasp. The rebels \"have surrounded Hama city from three sides, and are now present at a distance of three to four kilometres (1.9 to 2.5 miles) from it\", said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said the government forces were \"left with only one exit towards Homs to the south\". In more than a decade of war, Aleppo had never entirely fallen out of government hands. Bitcoin topped the $100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump rolls on. The milestone comes just hours after the President-elect signaled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry when he said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election Nov. 5. The cryptocurrency climbed dramatically from $69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as $103,713 on Dec. 4, according to CoinDesk. Just two years ago, bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Investors began returning in large numbers as global inflation started to cool - and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, or exchange traded funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it.

  "title": "Solana Price Surges 33 %, But Traders Eye ICO With 1 , 328 % Yield",
  "content": " Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverageThe Solana price surged 33% in the past month and 2% in the last 24 hours to trade at $240.46 as of 3.40 a.m. EST on trading volume that soared 16% to $8.82 billion. SOL is one of many cryptos that skyrocketed in November due to the excitement that spread throughout the crypto sector after Donald Trump’s election win. The President-elect is expected to bring more favorable laws and rules for the crypto industry once he returns to the White House. The SOL price previously managed to climb even higher and reach an all-time high around two weeks ago, on November 23, when its price skyrocketed to $263.83, finally beating the record that its price held since November 2021. While the SOL price is still 2% higher than it was 24 hours ago, the coin has started seeing a price dip, likely caused by the sell-off that took BTC from $103.5k to its current $98.24k. However, technical indicators suggest that the SOL price is unlikely to drop too low, as a support at $235 is likely to hold its price from further descent. The fifth-largest coin by market cap has seen its Bollinger bands narrow over the last six hours or so, while the price went from pushing the upper band late last night to sticking closely to the lower band throughout the night. It briefly returned to the middle point between the two bands several hours ago, only to then once again drop to the bottom one and start pushing it down. However, the coin seemingly has a support at $235, which might hold it from sinking further. Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) value also suggests that this might be the case, as the RSI stopped its descent slightly before reaching the oversold zone at 30. It bounced back after reaching the value of 36, suggesting that traders may have been quick to move in and buy the dip, although this may prove to be a small interruption in the sell-off, which could yet continue. While Bitcoin’s price managed to recover to $98.1k since yesterday’s drop, the rest of the crypto industry is still trading in the red, Solana included. The altcoin market seems to be lagging behind the largest cryptocurrency, but with SOL’s RSI now quite near the oversold zone, traders could start moving in to buy the dip, especially if Bitcoin starts recovering in the hours to come. However, if the sell-off does continue, SOL could break the support at $235 and potentially drop further to an even greater support at $230, which it tested several times over the past three days. Promising Alternative To Solana Right now, traders are trying to decide whether to buy, sell, or HODL Solana, while some have opted to walk a different path and pursue cryptos that are still in presale. One analyst favorite right now is BEST, the native token of Best Wallet.

  "content": " Market spotlight has now turned on the payrolls data due from the U.S. on Friday morning. Markets expect the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with conducting monetary policy to support the goals of maximum employment and stable prices to take cognizance of the price pressures emanating from the labor market. The unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 4.2 percent in November from 4.1 percent in the previous month. Markets also expect the addition to payrolls to record 200 thousand versus 12 thousand in the previous month. Average hourly earnings, another key labor market metric is expected to edge down on a monthly as well as yearly basis. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve, in its decision which is 12 days away is still expected to reduce rates. However, as shown in the CME FedWatch tool, the likelihood of a quarter-point Fed rate cut in December has decreased to 68 percent whereas the expected probability of a status quo has increased to 32 percent. Wall Street Futures are in mildly negative territory. European benchmarks are trading in the green zone. Asian benchmarks closed on a mixed note. The Dollar Index edged up.

Das said price stability is a mandate given to them and growth is also very important, while he noted the last mile of disinflation is prolonged and recent growth slowdown will lead to downward revision for full-year growth. Das acknowledged that inflation crossed the upper band and food inflation pressures will linger with food prices to start easing only in Q4, while headline inflation is likely to be elevated in Q3 and he noted a status quo in this policy is appropriate and essential. Das said the near-term inflation and growth outlook has turned somewhat adverse, while India's FY25 real GDP growth forecast was cut to 6.6% versus 7.2% previously and the FY25 CPI inflation forecast was raised to 4.8% versus 4.5% previously.

The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Omar Albam / AP / APSmoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing.

  "title": "Sui Price Pumps 15 % And Is This The Next Crypto to Skyrocket ? ",
  "content": " Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverageThe Sui price surged 15% in the last 24 hours to trade at $4.35 as of 2.30 a.m. EST on trading volume that skyrocketed 69% to $4.27 billion. The SUI price surge came after the project announced breaking news yesterday, revealing that Phantom, a crypto wallet built for DeFi and NFTs, is coming to the Sui ecosystem. 🚨BREAKING NEWS 🚨 @Phantom is coming to the Sui ecosystem! One wallet. Endless possibilities. Intuitive multichain features. ✨ From native bridges to seamless asset swaps, you’ll soon be able to explore everything Sui has to offer with the wallet trusted by millions.… pic.twitter.com/8jnDAgJUns — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 5, 2024 Sui praised its intuitive multichain features and endless possibilities that the wallet can enable, from native bridges to seamless asset swaps. It also said that crypto users will soon be able to explore everything Sui has to offer with the wallet trusted by millions. “The integration of Phantom Wallet with Sui represents a giant leap for the Sui ecosystem, which now gets access to a first-class wallet experience with several features that the Sui community has been asking for,” said athe Sui Foundation’s Global Head of Ecosystem, Jameel Khalfan. ”Phantom Wallet is selective about which chains it supports, and we are proud to now be included among this notable group.” Sui Price Prediction The SUI price has been performing quite well since the announcement was made, although it did encounter a strong resistance at $4.40 which kept it from progressing further over the past 16 hours or so. Now, however, the project is finally giving signs that this resistance might be broken, which could enable its price to continue going further up. While its Bollinger bands narrowed after the initial surge, they have remained relatively consistent since then, with the price mostly fluctuating between the upper band and the middle area between the two bands. Right now, it is once again pushing the upper band further up, which could result in greater widening provided that the price can break the resistance. The project’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) value has also been on the rise, after spending most of the last day fluctuating in the upper part of the neutral zone. Its value was mostly moving between 50 and 60 and back again in the past day, suggesting an overall bullish sentiment, but also the traders’ hesitance to go all in and pump the price. The new buying wave in the past few hours seems to be changing that, and the RSI is now growing sharply, which could push it to the value of 70, the start of the overbought area, while that would likely push the price to the value of $4.40, and possibly beyond. However, even if the price goes up to $4.40, it could see a rejection when the RSI value hits 70, or even if it goes beyond, so for the time being, stronger price fluctuations might be expected, but it is unlikely that SUI will skyrocket and establish a new bottom above this resistance. Promising Alternative To Sui While SUI’s partnership with Phantom Wallet brought a lot of excitement to its ecosystem, there is another crypto wallet that has recently been growing rapidly in popularity. This is, of course, Best Wallet — a Bitcoin and crypto wallet that describes itself as a multi-chain, non-custodial, and multi-wallet crypto wallet. The wallet supports over 60 different blockchains and is capable of storing all cryptocurrencies running on them, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and all other top chains with highly developed ecosystems.

  "title": "Best Crypto to Buy Now December 6 - Hedera , Aptos , Internet Computer",
  "content": " Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverageThe cryptocurrency market continues to exhibit bullish momentum, largely driven by Bitcoin’s significant 32% rise over the past month, reaching a record high of $103,583. This rally has also spurred activity in the altcoin market, with several assets gaining traction. Internet Computer (ICP) has begun to stand out, gradually participating in the broader uptrend. In the last 24 hours, ICP has climbed over 2%, contributing to an impressive 23% gain over the past week. The token is now trading at $14, reflecting growing investor interest. As the altcoin market gains momentum, analysts are closely monitoring trends to determine the best crypto to buy now. Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Now Hedera’s token recently surpassed the $0.20 threshold, marking its first return to this level in two years. Similarly, Crypto All-Stars has attracted significant attention during its presale, successfully raising over $9 million. Meanwhile, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has also demonstrated impressive growth, with its token currently trading at $2.03. 1. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera’s token has crossed the $0.20 mark for the first time in two years, driven by significant developments that have shifted market sentiment. At the time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.2798, reflecting an intraday dip of 6.97%. Despite this, the token has surged 81.44% over the past week and 463.16% over the past month, showing strong growth momentum. This rally seems to be fueled by two main developments. First, speculation around a potential collaboration between Ripple and Hedera has gained traction. This partnership could focus on creating a global settlement standard, with Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin expected to expand to the Hedera network. Second, Canary Capital’s filing for the first-ever Hedera HBAR spot ETF marks an essential step toward institutional adoption, providing traditional investors with direct access to HBAR. Meanwhile, HBAR is trading 229.66% above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.0849, highlighting its robust performance. The market sentiment remains bullish, supported by 20 green days in the past month and a 24-hour volume-to-market cap ratio of 0.2629, indicating healthy liquidity. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 67.88 suggests HBAR may soon experience sideways trading. Based on average December forecasts, HBAR is predicted to trade between $0.2885 and $0.3455 by year-end, offering potential returns of 15.40% to 23.16% from its current price. 2. Aptos (APT) Aptos is trading at $14.09 today, marking a 0.56% increase over the past 24 hours. The market sentiment around Aptos remains bullish, supported by the Fear & Greed Index at 72, indicating greed. The cryptocurrency is 51.75% above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $9.26, suggesting strong long-term performance. Additionally, Aptos has recorded 20 green days in the last 30 days, representing a 67% consistency in positive daily performance. Its high liquidity, relative to its market capitalization, adds to its appeal. As a Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, Aptos stands out with its innovative smart contract programming language, Move. This Rust-based language, developed by engineers behind Meta’s Diem blockchain, offers enhanced efficiency and flexibility. \"The world's most production-ready blockchain, Aptos…\" — yes. Aptos has been chosen to support @Galxe's @GravityChain network for its reliability, speed, security, scalable infrastructure, and performance. Together, we MOVE 🌐 https://t.co/5gYd2ppK0p — Aptos (@Aptos) December 5, 2024 Furthermore, Aptos aims to address blockchain limitations by creating a decentralized network capable of processing billions of transactions. During India Blockchain Week 2024, co-founder and CTO Avery Ching highlighted the platform’s ambition to support diverse internet applications and expand the Web3 ecosystem. Aptos also plans to incorporate payments for loyalty programs and coupons integrating major stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and a planned Hong Kong dollar stablecoin. Additionally, the company is working on AI solutions, enabling blockchain interactions with AI agents. India plays a key role in Aptos’ growth, with its expanding Web3 developer community driving innovation and adoption. 3. Internet Computer (ICP) Internet Computer (ICP) has garnered considerable attention amid the broader market’s bullish trend. The token shows potential for further gains with a strong breakout and positive momentum. Traders are closely monitoring the $10.90 resistance level, as a breakout above this point could signal a continuation of its upward trajectory. Currently, ICP is trading at $14.71, reflecting a 2.39% intraday increase. Over the past year, its price has surged by 196%, outperforming 69% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This strong performance highlights its appeal to investors. Additionally, the token trades 55.89% above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $9.39, signaling sustained long-term strength. The token’s recent market activity has been favorable, with 19 green days out of the last 30 (63%) demonstrating consistent upward movement. Moreover, its current price reflects a positive trend compared to its initial token sale valuation. Sentiment around Internet Computer remains optimistic, with a bullish price prediction and a Fear & Greed Index score of 72, indicating market greed. While short-term movements may vary, ICP’s performance and positioning suggest it could remain a key contender in the cryptocurrency market for the foreseeable future. 4. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is currently trading at $2.03, reflecting a 12% increase in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the token has shown a notable surge of 24.09%, underlining growing interest among market participants. It remains above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1.42193, trading 43.22% higher, which indicates sustained upward momentum. The cryptocurrency has recorded 17 green days in the past 30 days, or 57% of the time, highlighting its relatively consistent performance. Additionally, FET is trading near its cycle high and exhibits strong liquidity when compared to its market capitalization. These factors collectively point to significant demand and investor confidence in the token. From a technical perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently near 65. This level suggests that bullish momentum is present, but the asset is not overbought, leaving room for potential gains. The bullish trajectory appears intact as long as FET maintains its position above the breakout zone. Price forecasts suggest that FET could close the year within the $2.01–$2.29 range. If December’s average price reaches $2.15, this would imply a 5.92% rise from current levels. 5. Crypto All-Stars (STARS) Crypto All-Stars (STARS) has garnered considerable attention, raising over $9 million during its presale. This milestone reflects robust community support and potential growth opportunities. With just 14 days remaining in the presale, investor interest appears to be intensifying, with many speculating on the possibility of significant returns once the token is listed on exchanges. The project introduces an innovative staking platform called MemeVault, designed to cater to the growing interest in meme coins. This ecosystem allows users to stake popular tokens and earn rewards in STARS, the native token of the Crypto All-Stars platform. At its launch, MemeVault will support 11 widely recognized meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin, with plans to expand the roster over time. The platform also offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 300%, which may appeal to high-risk investors, though it carries the inherent risks associated with high-yield staking. The project’s roadmap indicates that the presale will conclude on December 20, with the token expected to debut on exchanges shortly afterward. Community discussions on platforms such as Telegram highlight keen interest in the project’s liquidity allocation strategy, aiming to ensure smooth trading post-launch.

  "title": "Crafting Headlines That Captivate : 19 Styles Every Writer Should Master - By Isaac Asabor",
  "content": " In the world of writing, whether for journalism, marketing, or creative storytelling, the headline is the first handshake with your audience. It is the singular moment where a reader decides whether to proceed or scroll past. Headlines serve as the gateway to the story, setting the tone, creating expectations, and, more importantly, sparking curiosity. Therefore, it is germane at this juncture to disclose that this article explores 19 headline styles that writers can leverage to command attention and achieve their objectives, while also delving deeper into the significance of crafting impactful headlines. In fact, headlines are more than just titles; they are a strategic tool in writing. Research shows that online readers spend mere seconds skimming through content, often deciding based on the headline alone whether the article is worth their time. In print, the headline competes with other stories for the reader’s focus, while in marketing, it serves as the hook to capture interest and drive conversions. A compelling headline can mean the difference between your message being heard or ignored. From a journalistic perspective, headlines must strike a balance between being informative and engaging. For instance, in breaking news, a straightforward and factual headline is crucial. On the other hand, feature articles often benefit from creativity and emotional appeal to draw readers into the narrative. Similarly, in copywriting and advertising, the headline is often the first, and sometimes the only, opportunity to make an impression. To illustrate the breadth of possibilities, here are 19 headline styles that writers can use across various subjects and genres. Firstly, the “Direct Headline” is effective for delivering the essence of a story succinctly. It is the go-to style when clarity and immediacy are essential. For example, “Scientists Discover Cure for Common Cold” leaves no ambiguity about the topic. Secondly, the “Indirect Headline” piques curiosity by hinting at the story without giving away the details. An example like “When Innovation Meets Resistance” intrigues readers to explore further. This style is particularly useful for features or opinion pieces where mystery adds value. In a similar vein, the “Breaking News Headline” emphasizes timeliness and significance. Headlines such as “Earthquake Hits California, Thousands Displaced” are crucial in news reporting, where immediacy and impact are paramount. Also, the “How-To Headline” is ideal for practical and instructional content. Headlines like “How to Create a Stunning Resume in Five Easy Steps” resonate with readers seeking solutions or learning opportunities. This style is highly effective for self-help, tutorials, and educational pieces. Still in a similar vein, the “Question Headline” engages readers by directly addressing their concerns or curiosity. An example like “What Does the Future Hold for Electric Vehicles?” invites readers to seek answers within the article. The “Command Headline” which is the sixth headline, uses an authoritative tone to compel action or interest. For instance, “Start Investing Today to Secure Your Future” directs readers toward a specific goal or idea. Seventhly, the “Reason-Why Headline” organizes information in a structured, list-based format. A headline such as “7 Reasons Why You Should Visit Iceland This Summer” appeals to readers who enjoy digestible, enumerated content. Eighthly, the “Emotional Headline” taps into human feelings to foster a connection. For example, “Heartbroken Parents Share Their Stories After School Shooting” evokes empathy and compels readers to engage with the story. Also, the “Wordplay Headline” adds a touch of creativity and humor, making even complex topics more palatable. An example like “The ‘App’-etizer Economy: How Tech Startups Are Feeding Growth” blends cleverness with relevance. Tenthly, the “Brand Name Headline” incorporates well-known names to add context or credibility. A headline such as “Apple vs. Samsung: The Battle for Smartphone Supremacy” leverages brand recognition to attract readers. Moreover, the “Best Headline” highlights the crème de la crème of any category. For instance, “The 10 Best Movies to Watch This Holiday Season” appeals to readers seeking curated recommendations. Furthermore, the “Two-Part Headline” combines two related ideas for added impact. An example like “Climate Change: A Crisis or an Opportunity?” juxtaposes contrasting perspectives to engage readers. Similarly, the “Relational Headline” personalizes the subject, making it relatable to the audience. A headline like “Here Is How to Stay Fit While Working a Desk Job” connects directly with readers’ experiences. In addition, the “Location-Specific Headline” targets a regional audience. For example, “Why Seattle is Leading the Green Energy Revolution” resonates with a geographically focused demographic. Moreover, the “Challenging Belief Headline” uses reverse psychology or unconventional statements to provoke interest. A headline like “Why Failure Might Be the Best Thing for Your Career” challenges conventional wisdom to grab attention. Additionally, the “Confrontational Headline” takes a bold stance to ignite debate. For instance, “Traditional Publishing is Dying: Here’s Why” invites readers into a discussion. Another style, the “Testimonial Headline”, uses personal stories to humanize a subject. An example such as “‘I Quit My Job and Found Happiness,’ Says Former Executive” adds authenticity to the narrative. Furthermore, the “Backed-by-Science Headline” uses data or research findings to enhance credibility. For instance, “Studies Show Meditation Reduces Anxiety by 40%” appeals to evidence-driven readers. Finally, the “Background Headline” sets the stage by providing context before diving into specifics. A headline like “The History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Blockchain” prepares readers for a detailed exploration. The strategic application of these headline styles can elevate any piece of writing, whether for news articles, blog posts, or advertisements. Headlines function as the bridge between the writer’s intent and the reader’s engagement, ensuring the message is not only seen but also understood. For professional writers, understanding the nuances of headline crafting can sharpen their skills and broaden their appeal. It is a craft that requires practice, creativity, and a deep understanding of the audience. Whether you aim to inform, persuade, or entertain, the right headline style can make your writing stand out in a crowded digital landscape. In fact, headlines are the unsung heroes of compelling communication. They are the first impression, the initial handshake, and the deciding factor in whether a piece of writing resonates. By mastering these 19 headline styles, writers can not only capture attention but also foster meaningful connections with their audience. The next time you craft a headline, let these strategies inspire your creativity and elevate your work to new heights. Post Views: 140 "

  "title": "El Salvador president is triumphant after his bet on bitcoin comes true",
  "content": " SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — As bitcoin reached historic highs, surpassing $100,000 for the first tim e, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele was triumphant on Thursday about his big bet on the cryptocurrency.The adoption of bitcoin — which has been legal tender in the Central American nation since 2021 — never quite matched the president’s enthusiasm, but the value of the government’s reported investment now stands at more than $600 million.Bitcoin has rallied mightily since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, exceeding the $100,000 mark on Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Just two years ago, bitcoin’s volatile value fell below $17,000. Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting just above $99,000 by 3 p.m. E.T. Bukele on Thursday blamed his beleaguered political opposition for causing many Salvadorans to miss out on the bonanza.There were street protests when the Congress made bitcoin legal tender in June 2021, though that move was not the only motivation for the protesters. The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador’s unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home. The government offered $30 in bitcoin to those who signed up for digital wallets. Many did so, but quickly cashed out the cryptocurrency.“It’s important to emphasize that not only did the opposition err resoundingly with bitcoin, but rather, differently from other issues (where they have also been wrong), this time their opposition affected many,” Bukele wrote on Facebook.Bukele drew an “impressive” comment from Elon Musk on the social media platform X Thursday. El Salvador’s former Central Bank President Carlos Acevedo pointed out on Thursday that while there has been a gain, it remains an unrealized one until the government’s bitcoin is sold. That said, he credited Bukele’s administration with doing well on the bitcoin move, especially in light of Trump’s election.Acevedo said “the markets’ optimism that a Trump administration will be friendly with the markets and particularly with bitcoin” explained its sustained rally over the past month.But the cryptocurrency’s volatility was a persistent risk, he said.“The average Salvadoran doesn’t use bitcoin, but obviously there are Salvadorans with economic resources who even before had already invested in bitcoin, but it is a small group,” Acevedo said.Esteban Escamilla, a worker in a clothing store in Santa Tecla, outside the capital San Salvador, said he had cashed out the original $30 of bitcoin offered in 2021. “I don’t use bitcoin because I don’t have (money) to invest and speculate with, but I know it has gone up a lot,” he said, recognizing that he would have more money now if he had kept it in bitcoin.Josefa Torres, 45, said as she was doing her grocery shopping that she didn’t have any bitcoin either. “I took out the money and used it for household expenses,” she said. At the conclusion of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and El Salvador’s government in August, the IMF issued a statement that mentioned the country’s bitcoin holdings.“While many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project,” the IMf said.

  "title": "Bitcoin Breaks $100 , 000 . Is It Too Late to Buy ? ",
  "content": " It finally happened. Bitcoin (BTC -1.88%) smashed through the (mostly psychological) $100,000 barrier, just 14 years after it passed the $1 mark for the first time. That is an absolutely incredible ascent. The moment comes as Bitcoin is in the midst of a nearly 50% rally since early last month. Several catalysts are likely responsible, but the most recent is certainly the election of Donald Trump. The incoming administration appears likely to be friendly to crypto based on statements from the campaign trail, like his promise to make America the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" President-elect Trump's recent pick of Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission signals a sharp departure from the previous administration -- a welcome one for the industry. As anyone who has followed Bitcoin's journey even slightly knows, however, this excitement and euphoria can turn sharply. Already, Bitcoin has pulled back a bit below the $100,000 mark as of the morning of Dec. 6. The past is never a guarantee of the future, but at some point, this rally has to end -- the question is when. So, with Bitcoin smashing records, is now still a good time to buy? Bitcoin ETFs and institutions are playing a big role Optimism around the incoming Trump administration's attitude toward crypto is hardly the only factor at play here. In January, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, broadening access for all investors and adding legitimacy to the market. These ETFs, traded like traditional stocks, simplify buying and selling Bitcoin by bypassing crypto exchanges, allowing more traditionally minded investors to use their normal broker. The stamp of approval from the chief regulatory agency of financial markets has helped to change minds in what I suspect was a profound way, opening the door to capital too afraid to join in previously. In part because of these ETFs, institutional investment has increased, further legitimizing the market. The greater buy-in from institutions enhances liquidity and aligns Bitcoin's price more closely with its true value -- what is referred to as an efficient market -- which in turn brings more institutions into the fold. Institutions are critical for the future of Bitcoin's growth as it is still a rather niche investment for the average American; less than 15% of adults own digital assets, compared to two-thirds that own stocks. About 63% of U.S. adults doubt crypto's safety. This is a lower number than it once was, but it is a far cry from being in the mainstream. Institutions can change that. And, if you are already invested, it's a great thing; there is a whole lot of capital still on the sidelines. Things look good for Bitcoin, but is now the right time to invest? Warren Buffett's famous advice is to be \"fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" With Bitcoin near $100,000 and up 150% from earlier this year, it seems greed may have taken over. Now might seem like the time to be fearful, but as I said, almost two-thirds of Americans are still fearful of crypto, and the vast majority do not own it, so maybe now is the time to be \"greedy.\" I'll say this: The approach you should take depends largely on the kind of investor you are. You can get into trouble trying to time a market, and the truth is, the impact of buying in at all-time-highs isn't as severe as you might think -- if you don't sell after a major correction or crash. This is the key. Crashes and corrections will come. Many people who invested at the top in 2021 are kicking themselves right now because they lost faith and sold in 2022, netting as much as a 75% loss. If they had instead held to today, they would be up 50%. If you are a risk-tolerant investor and you know you can avoid selling if Bitcoin's value crashes, don't avoid buying in now just because it is hovering around an all-time high.

  "title": "Why Altcoins Were Skyrocketing in Price This Week",
  "content": " For what feels like the umpteenth time this year, cryptocurrencies were having quite a stretch over the past few trading days. Buoyed by lingering optimism following the presidential election, they recently got an extra boost when one of their ilk finally vaulted over a very high price level. Aided by this, many cryptos, no matter how obscure or lightly capitalized, were booking double-digit price gains. For example, as of early Friday morning, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, adorable dog-themed meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB -1.69%) had advanced by almost 18% and the more utilitarian Cardano (ADA -2.07%) was up by 12%. Meanwhile, Litecoin (LTC -7.83%) and Chainlink (LINK -1.63%) were soaring even higher, with respective increases of 35% and 32%. The $100,000 coin Those gains are undeniably impressive, but the No. 1 star of the week was not an altcoin. It was the pioneering and leading name in this asset class, Bitcoin. The coin smashed its all-time high price and did so in style, crossing the $100,000 mark after a run of nail-biting days bouncing around just under that level. As any seasoned crypto investor can attest, what's good for Bitcoin is good for cryptos generally, as they more often than not follow the leader's trajectory. There isn't much getting in the way of a broad rally just now, save for these rapidly ballooning prices. The economy continues to motor along, inflation seems to be cooling (although not as rapidly as some would like), and relatively few other financial assets are producing the kinds of returns generated by the Shiba Inus and Cardanos of the world. The cherry on top is the coming arrival, in barely over one month, of a new presidential administration clearly sympathetic to the crypto industry. All of this gives the feeling of a sustainable, and potentially long-term, rally for coins and tokens. I'd be a little cautious here, though, since we're at the point where this market is growing increasingly vulnerable to even minor negative news. Investors tend to get touchy when asset prices grow fast and broadly; the higher they climb, as the common wisdom goes, the harder they can fall. We might not be in for a bear market just yet, but... If that occurs, I'd envision altcoins taking a steeper tumble than Bitcoin. Why? Well, for the most part they ascended higher and quicker than No. 1, on the back of investors seeking alternate high-returners while Bitcoin agonizingly teased that $100,000 level. There's also some doubt creeping into the market about whether the crypto king is really worthy of a six-figure price tag. After all, the coin's real-world utility leaves much to be desired, and with its volatility it might not be a reliable store of value besides. Eric Volkman has positions in Bitcoin.

  "title": "Meet the Next AI Darling That Citron Research Andrew Left Says Can Double . Nvidia Is an Investor and Not a Single Wall Street Analyst Covers the Stock . ",
  "content": " Citron Research's Andrew Left made some big calls as of late. Recently, Left went short on Michael Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, suggesting that the data company and large buyer of Bitcoin is now trading detached from Bitcoin fundamentals. The call is interesting because Citron and Left four years ago said MicroStrategy was the best way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, although part of the short thesis is due to expanding access to Bitcoin. Left is now making another bold call, claiming he's found Wall Street's next artificial intelligence (AI) darling. The call conveniently occurred on the same day that AI chip king Nvidia participated in a $700 million private placement for the company that also included the venture capital giant Accel and global investment firm Orbis Investments. Let's meet this new potential AI darling and see if it is as promising as Left says. From Russia with love Citron's shoutout and Nvidia's investment may have been the first time you heard of the AI infrastructure company Nebius Group (NBIS 13.09%). How is that possible? Well, Nebius has been on an interesting journey. Until October, the stock hadn't traded on the public markets for three years. That's because the Amsterdam-based company used to be owned by a Russian search engine giant called Yandex. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russian-affiliated companies. Earlier this year, the international assets were split off from Yandex in a $5.4 billion deal. Nebius was manifested to bear four divisions including cloud, data labeling, self-driving automobiles, and education technology, and Nebius began trading on the Nasdaq again on Oct. 21. Nebius is part of a growing list of companies that rent their infrastructure to AI companies. Powering AI is expensive and energy-intensive because it involves storing vast data quantities and hardware that powers AI language models. Nebius provides computing capabilities, storage, and tools and services for developers. The company's core AI platform is intended to handle massive AI workloads. Companies looking to develop AI capabilities can pay a subscription to use the infrastructure offered by companies like Nebius. A quick find It didn't take long for investors to discover Nebius -- the stock is up 55% on the year following the Nvidia news and plug from Citron. In a post on X, Citron's account called Nebius \"a sleeper with no analyst coverage yet, the market hasn't caught on to its massive potential -- or its undervaluation vs. CoreWeave.\" CoreWeave is another AI infrastructure company rumored to be preparing a public offering that could value the company at $35 billion. If Nebius trades at a 50% discount to CoreWeave, that results in a $60 stock price, according to Citron. Nebius traded below $28 when Citron posted about it on Dec. 3. Citron also said that CEO Arkady Volozh, who resigned from the company after the initial sanctions but is now back, \"is the real deal.\" The researcher also said that Nvidia had been waiting for the company to complete the spin-off from its Russian parent to announce the deal. Interestingly, Nebius on its website says its customers will be some of the first to use Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform. Nebius projects revenue will grow 200% to 300% in 2025 to a range of $500 million to $700 million. The company plans to spend anywhere from $600 million to $1.5 billion for more capacity at its data centers in Finland, France, and North America. It's always nice to find stocks you are interested in before they receive coverage on the Street. Wall Street analysts have the ears of many institutional investors at large funds that can move the needle, although the Nvidia investment and attention from Citron preempted some of this. Nebius is not yet profitable, but is growing revenue rapidly and has about $2.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet and very little debt. Nebius also operates in a huge market and already has some kind of partnership with Nvidia. Let's also not forget that it's in one of the hottest sectors of the stock market receiving huge valuations. Investors can certainly take a starter position. There may be some push and pull given the company's background, but the stock looks cheap compared to other AI names. Bram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin, Nebius Group, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. "

This week, malicious npm versions targeted Solana users, Brazilian banking giant entered cryptocurrency trading, a Nebraska man pleaded guilty to cryptojacking in Brooklyn federal court, Australia tightened rules for crypto businesses and crypto losses in 2024 dropped 15%. Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin said it will cease operations.See Also: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions with Permissioned DeFi Malicious npm Versions Target Solana Users Cybersecurity researchers uncovered a supply chain attack targeting the widely used @solana/web3.js npm package, which helps developers interact with the Solana blockchain. Researchers from Socket found two malicious versions, 1.95.6 and 1.95.7, containing code designed to steal private keys and drain cryptocurrency wallets. The affected package, downloaded over 400,000 times weekly, has since been removed from the npm registry. The attack allegedly occurred after attackers compromised the npm account of the package's maintainers through a phishing attack. The malicious code in these versions of the package added a backdoor that exfiltrated private keys via seemingly legitimate CloudFlare headers, sending them to a remote server. This breach targeted projects handling private keys, such as decentralized applications, but did not impact non-custodial wallets that don’t expose private keys during transactions. Users of the package are advised to update to the latest secure version and rotate their keys if compromised. Brazilian Banking Giant Enters Cryptocurrency Trading Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco, launched cryptocurrency trading services on Monday through its investment platform. Clients of Brazil's largest bank can initially trade Bitcoin and Ether, with plans to expand offerings as crypto regulations evolve, said Guto Antunes, head of digital assets. Founded in 1924 Itau Unibanco manages over $526 billion in total assets and will safeguard customers' digital assets through its in-house custody services, according to BeinCrypto. The move positions Itau to compete with local players like MB and BTG Pactual's Mynt and global giants such as Binance. Itau distinguishes itself by acting as a custodian, safeguarding users' digital assets. The launch follows recent exits by Brazilian firms XP and PicPay, highlighting regulatory uncertainties in the country’s growing cryptocurrency market. CP30 Pleads Guilty to Cryptojacking A Nebraska man who stole $3.5 million worth of cloud computing services to mine just under a million dollars worth of cryptocurrency plead guilty Thursday to wire fraud in Brooklyn federal court.Prosecutors indicted the man, Charles O. Parks III - known online as \"CP30\" - with six criminal counts. Parks ran a cryptojacking operation from January 2021 through August of that year, using a variety of names, corporate affiliations and email addresses to register accounts with cloud providers. He created email domains for two corporate entities he created in the names of \"MultiMillionaire LLC\" and \"CP3O LLC.\" He laundered the cryptocurrency through exchanges, a non-fungible token marketplace, an online payment provider and traditional bank accounts. Once converted into dollars, Parks used the ill-gotten gains on purchases including a Mercedes Benz luxury car, jewelry and first-class hotel and travel expenses. He faces up to two decades in prison in sentencing. Australia Tightens Rules for Crypto Businesses The Australian Securities and Investments Commission proposed stricter licensing requirements for crypto businesses to enhance consumer protection and market integrity.

SBI VC Trade plans to take over DMM Bitcoin’s 14 cryptocurrency trading offerings before the asset transfer. Both companies are finalizing details, including the transfer method and timeline.

  "title": "House Financial Services alum rejoins BGR Group",
  "content": " BGR Group is bringing back Matt Hoffmann three years after he left the lobbying giant to become the Republican staff director for the House Financial Services Committee. As a principal and the new co-head of the firm’s financial services practice group, Hoffmann will focus on cryptocurrency and digital assets regulation, banking, capital markets and the next iteration of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Investment Act (TCJA), a top priority for Republicans with several provisions set to expire in 2026. BGR Group Chairman and CEO Bob Wood called Hoffmann — also a former policy director at the Senate Finance Committee and senior adviser to former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) on the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees — “a tremendous asset to our firm and our clients as we navigate upcoming tax and financial services policy debates.” During his time as chief adviser to House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of the many things Hoffmann said he was “lucky” to have worked on was the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill to pass the chamber earlier this year. “I think that the the environment for productive, substantive policy development, bringing traditional finance and the crypto industry closer together,” Hoffmann told The Hill. “Now is the time for that work.” Crypto has been on a tear since Trump won and began appointing industry-friendly regulators to key positions in the incoming administration. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time this week after the president-elect announced his pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When asked about the possibility of comprehensive crypto legislation being signed into law over the next two years, Hoffmann described himself as an “eternal optimist.” “I am optimistic that we’re gonna get something over the finish line,” he said. When Hoffmann briefly joined the blockchain technology company Digital Asset this summer as director of regulatory and government affairs, McHenry praised him for helping “Committee Republicans achieve our objectives while maintaining the bipartisanship necessary to secure lasting results.” McHenry is retiring at the end of this Congress, but Hoffmann didn’t seem worried about the upcoming leadership transition on the committee. “The senior leadership on that committee is exceptional. They have been involved in the space for a very long time and all of them were intimately involved in not just the crypto legislation, but our national security stuff, our banking regulations, the banking work that we did,” he said.

  "title": "Budget chaos in France and South Korea strengthens case for Bitcoin",
  "content": " Political turbulence in France and South Korea is reigniting global debates on the appeal of decentralized, non-government-backed currencies, such as Bitcoin. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory and asset management organizations, comes as in France, a no-confidence vote is poised to topple Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s fragile coalition. The looming political fallout, fueled by an unresolved budget crisis and mounting deficit concerns, threatens further instability in Europe’s second-largest economy. Budget Minister Laurent Saint-Martin has warned that ousting the government would exacerbate fiscal challenges and fuel public anxiety. Meanwhile, in a drastic move that echoes a dark chapter of South Korea’s past, President Yoon Suk Yeol has declared martial law, citing threats from opposition leaders. The decision, amid a budget impasse in parliament, marks the first such declaration since the military dictatorship of the 1980s. The specter of authoritarian measures in a leading Asian democracy has rattled markets and citizens alike. Nigel Green says: “When governments falter or act unpredictably, people inevitably seek alternatives that don’t rely on institutional trust. That’s where decentralized currencies come in.” Unlike fiat currencies, which are subject to political whims and policy decisions, digital assets like Bitcoin operate independently of government control. Their decentralized nature helps with concerns regarding security, transparency, and resistance to manipulation, making them increasingly attractive in times of political uncertainty. “When that trust is shaken—as we’re seeing in both France and South Korea—people look for assets that are not susceptible to government interference. Non-government currencies offer precisely that.” deVere’s forecasts indicate that the current political turmoil will likely accelerate the adoption of digital currencies across Europe and Asia, in particular. Digital assets typically also offer practical advantages: lower transaction costs, faster cross-border payments, and greater financial inclusion, especially for those underserved by traditional banking systems. For investors, the message is clear: political risk is a growing factor that cannot be ignored. Diversification into decentralized assets is becoming a prudent strategy to hedge against instability in government-backed financial systems. The deVere chief executive predicts that Bitcoin, which has already experienced significant gains this year, almost hitting $100,000, will likely continue to climb. The implications extend beyond individual portfolios. Institutions and corporations are also recognizing the strategic value of holding digital assets. From tech giants to hedge funds, the move toward crypto is gathering momentum. “As France braces for its most consequential no-confidence vote in decades, and South Korea faces the repercussions of martial law, the world watches anxiously. “The outcomes in both countries will undoubtedly shape global market sentiment and policy decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” concludes Nigel Green.

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day. Today's top stories Syrian opposition forces stormed Hama city in central Syria yesterday as part of their largest offensive in years against President Bashar al-Assad's government. The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Smoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. Omar Albam/AP hide caption toggle caption Omar Albam/AP 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing.

  "title": "Hawk Tuah girl : Online star faces crypto coin criticism",
  "content": "Getty ImagesHaliey Welch, known mostly as the star of the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" meme, is facing criticism after her newly launched cryptocurrency nosedived in value.Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.She added that no \"KOL\" (key opinion leaders) were gifted a free token.Ms Welch had previously distributed free Hawk tokens to some fans ahead of the launch across social media.Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain at around 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, and its market capitalisation soared to highs of $490m shortly after.However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.A community note on Ms Welch's X post contests her explanation, saying her team had been selling their Hawk coins since launch.Scam allegationsCoffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, also claimed that Hawk gave \"insiders\" an advantage.\"Unfortunately with situations like this, they're not targeting crypto bros, they're mostly targeting actual fans who have never been involved in the crypto space before,\" he said in a video viewed more than 1.4 million times.He accused Ms Welch's team of \"profiting from a rug pull\". \"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.Ms Welch's post on X claimed that her team attempted to prevent so-called \"snipers\", who buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly at moments when they are likely to make the most money from a gap in buy and sell price - sometimes using automated trading tools - by imposing higher fees on one exchange.The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post. It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.More recently, YouTuber Logan Paul was accused of misleading fans by promoting crypto coins or investments without divulging his own financial interest in them.Who is 'Hawk Tuah Girl' Haliey Welch?Known online as the \"Hawk Tuah girl\", Ms Welch went viral after speaking the onomatopoeia \"hawk tuah\" - imitating the sound of someone spitting - during an interview in June.It made the 22-year-old, from Belfast, Tennessee, an overnight internet sensation. She amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across various social platforms and launched her own merchandise and a podcast called \"Talk Tuah\".Getty ImagesMs Welch, who often wears a cowboy hat and boots, was mimicked in a Saturday Night Live sketch in September by Chloe FinemanHer manager told the Hollywood Reporter in July that she was unique in not having sought out internet fame, having been off social media for mental health reasons for several months before appearing in the now-viral \"Hawk Tuah\" video. Rolling Stone has likened her funny, small-town personality to a \"Gen Z Dolly Parton\". Ms Welch told outlet TMZ ahead of Hawk's launch on Wednesday that she launched it to tackle \"a bunch of imposters\" pretending to be her and selling their own coins.\"It's a really good way to get all my fans and community to interact and come together,\" she said."

  "content": " FTSE 100 down 37 points Direct Line accepts Aviva bid House prices hit new high 3.56pm: FTSE 100 heads towards weekend lower London’s blue chip index came under pressure on Friday and headed into late trading down 37 points at 8,311. Over the week, the index looked set for a gain, having risen 0.3% since Monday. A lack of any major movers saw Severn Trent PLC (LSE:SVT) and United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) top Friday’s fallers after both receiving downgrades by Jefferies analysts. Both were bumped from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’ ratings ahead of final proposals from regulator Ofwat this month on price controls and investment requirements for the coming years. Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS) also sat among the losers as investors appeared unimpressed with a bid to acquire Norwegian sporting goods retailer XXL. Heavyweights Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL) and BP PLC (LSE:BP.) fell too, in line with a further drop in oil prices. B&M European Value Retail SA (LSE:BME) led risers in the meantime, up 2.4%, alongside JD Sports Fashion PLC (LSE:JD.). Housebuilders Barratt Redrow PLC (LSE:BTRW) and Vistry Group PLC (LSE:VTY), alongside property portal Rightmove PLC (LSE:RMV), also edged higher after Halifax reported house prices hit a record in November earlier in the day. 3.29pm: Shell, BP slip as oil approaches $70 a barrel Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL) and BP PLC (LSE:BP.) both reversed on gains on Friday afternoon in line with a further decline for oil prices. Benchmark Brent crude fell to US$70.92 a barrel come the afternoon, marking a 1.8% drop for the day. Brent had traded as high as the US$74 mark midweek, but fears of a supply glut in 2025 appear to have persisted despite the OPEC+ cartel’s latest decision to extend output cuts. \"Crude oil’s outlook remains tied to evolving supply-demand dynamics,\" City Index analyst Fawad Razaqzada commented. \"Elevated interest rates, a strong US dollar, geopolitical tensions and struggling Chinese and Eurozone economies continue to weigh on demand. \"Meanwhile, rising non-OPEC production, including record US output, keeps supply pressures high.\" BP dropped 1.0% on Friday, while Shell fell 0.9%, leaving the heavyweights among those weighing on the FTSE 100, which slipped 30 points to 8,318. 3.14pm: Red weather warning prompts caution over insurance policies A rare red weather warning has been issued for some areas in the UK this weekend as Storm Darragh threatens to bring 90-mile-an-hour winds. Coastal areas of Wales and the South West have been hit with the “danger to life” warning, which will run over the course of Saturday morning. Amber warnings have been issued to surrounding regions by the Met Office, with yellow cautions stretching across vast expanses of the UK. Ahead of the storm’s arrival, Go.Compare spokesperson Tom Banks warned over driving in the worst-hit areas. “We would always recommend to avoid using in the car, unless absolutely necessary,” he said. Banks noted car insurance policies would not be invalidated but that “exceptions” may well be made. “Your car insurance will cover you as normal but if your insurer thinks you were driving irresponsibly or recklessly during a red weather warning, and you had an accident, it might not pay out your claim,” he added. “For example, if you drive in an area that has been closed by the police because of flooding and your car got damaged, your claim could be refused.” 2.43pm: US stocks open higher as rate cut hopes grow Wall Street was in a positive mood after non-farm payroll figures showed the addition of 127,000 jobs across the US economy in November on Friday. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 opened 0.3% higher, while the Dow Jones ticked up 0.2%. Markets had been braced for the non-farm payroll figures, which exceeded expectations, as the debate around whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest this month went on. Futures markets were pricing in an 89% chance of a December rate cut in the wake of the data, compared to 68% beforehand. “A strong November non-farm payrolls at 227,000 included some reversals from October and was further offset by a tick up in the unemployment rate to 4.24%,” Janus Henderson Investors’ Adam Hetts commented. “This big rebound from a distorted October read is actually quite balanced, should relieve some economic concerns, and keep the 18 December rate cut expectations on track. “Zooming out a bit from today, the trend of a slowly slowing labour market continues to sit in the sweet spot as far as rate cuts are concerned.” 1.56pm: Pound jumps against dollar on US job figures Sterling racked up a gain against the dollar in the wake of figures showing the addition of 227,000 jobs to the US economy last month. The pound jumped to $1.2806 for a 0.36% rise over the day versus the greenback after news of the expectation-beating figure. Charles Schwab UK managing director Richard Flynn noted the data added to a string of figures showing resilience within the US economy and supported the view that the Federal Reserve could hold interest at its next meeting this month. 1.45pm: Federal Reserve could hold interest after jobs beat - analyst Expectation-beating non-farm payroll figures for November could leave the Federal Reserve inclined to hold interest rates later this month. Some 227,000 jobs were added to the US economy in November, against an upwardly revised 36,000 in October and against expectations for 200,000. Charles Schwab UK managing director Richard Flynn noted the figures added to “the recent spate of resilient economic data” in the US. “The economy has reached a point where it is growing healthily, with fairly full employment, and consistent wage growth,” he said. “We are seeing very little evidence that there are issues needing to be addressed. “Hope to preserve this period of calm may encourage the Fed to lean towards a ‘hold’ decision at its next meeting, particularly amidst uncertainty around how the upcoming change in government will impact the economy.” 1.35pm: US non-farm payrolls ahead of expectations The US economy added 227,000 jobs over the course of November, non-farm payroll figures showed on Friday. Expectations had been for the addition of 200,000 jobs, with the surge marking a bounceback after October’s upwardly revised reading of 36,000. Unemployment ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2% as expected in the meantime, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported. Futures showed Wall Street little moved on the news, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all seen in the red. 1.22pm: BoE official warns high interest hurting economy Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Swati Dhingra has cautioned that high interest rates are taking their toll on the economy. Dhingra, who has been consistently dovish since joining the rate-setting committee in September 2022, warned economic growth would be muted unless the bank opted to cut interest further from 4.75% at its next meeting this month. “We’re really paying the price,” she told Bloomberg TV. “Consumption has been very weak [and] businesses have been telling us for months that they’ve reduced investment. “So it’s a combination of all of those factors, the weak consumption, the weak investment, and possible damage to supply capacity is what I would worry about. “That’s why I think we should be easing policy more.” Dhingra signalled she would vote in favour of cutting rates at the bank’s next meeting on December 19, after November saw the committee vote eight to one for a 25 basis point reduction. 12.46pm: Frasers leads FTSE 100 fallers Acquisition-hungry Sports Direct owner Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS)’s bid to acquire all outstanding shares in Norwegian sporting goods retailer XXL has not gone down well with some factinons of Frasers’ investor base. Frasers is the biggest faller among the FTSE 100 set, dipping 2.6% a the time of writing. The proposed acquisition, if completed, values XXL at approximately 246.36 million Norwegian kroner (£17.5 million), offering a fairly underwhelming 25% premium over the company’s closing share price yesterday. The bid is “classic Frasers behaviour”, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “The approach is similar to Mulberry in that Frasers has fiercely criticised XXL’s fundraising efforts, this time implying the Norwegian retailer is making a bad decision with a reworked rights issue. “A proposed 25% bid premium isn’t generous yet XXL is on its knees and Frasers is factoring in high risks associated with the company,” he added. Frasers shares are currently swapping for 645p. The broader FTSE 100 set is currently down four points to 8,345. 12.09am: Mortgage rates fall every day of week as NatWest cuts Mortgage rates fell every day over the course of the week as NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) was among major lenders to scale back prices. According to Moneyfacts, interest on the average two-year fixed mortgage rate fell below the 5.5% mark once again, having sat at 5.4% in early November. Come Friday, interest on the typical two-year fix was at 5.4894%, against 5.5197% a week ago. NatWest on Thursday announced cuts of up to 0.39% across its two and five-year fixed rate mortgage products. Coventry Building Society then said on Friday that rates on all of its fixed rate mortgages would be reduced, including cuts of as much as 0.26% on residential deals. “This week has been mostly positive,” Orchard Financial Advisers managing director Ben Perks commented. “For the first time since the Budget, we’ve seen more reductions than increases. “It definitely feels like the winds are changing and hopefully they’ll continue to do so.” 11.27am: Nasdaq to fall as caution seen on Wall Street ahead of non-farm payrolls Wall Street appeared in a cautious mood ahead of Friday’s all-important non-farm payroll figures. Futures had the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all down by 0.1% ahead of the opening bell. Following the addition of just 12,000 jobs across the US economy through October, attention has been drawn to Friday’s figures for November. “Markets are hoping for a balanced outcome,” Tickmill Group partner Patrick Munnelly commented. “Not too strong to undermine the likelihood of a rate cut, nor too weak to spark concerns about economic health.” Expectations are for 200,000 jobs to have been added to the US economy over the month, with unemployment anticipated to come in at 4.2%, against 4.1% previously. 11.15am: Eurozone economy grows faster in third quarter Eurozone gross domestic product growth picked up over the third quarter, figures showed on Friday. GDP across the euro area climbed by 0.4% in the three months to September, against 0.2% over the previous quarter, a final reading from Eurostat showed. On an annual basis, the economy grew by 0.9%, following the second quarter’s 0.5% uptick. Germany, the continent’s largest economy, contracted by 0.3% against a year earlier though, while French GDP climbed by 1.2% in the meantime. 11.10am: Direct Line shares up 7% Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) shares remain well bid following an agreement to be taken over by FTSE 100 insurance giant Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.). The proposed combination includes 129.7p in cash and the rest in new Aviva shares, plus a 5p dividend payment subject to board approval. Aviva’s offer represents a 73.3% premium to Direct Line’s closing share price on November 27, when Aviva approached the group with its first, rejected takeover proposal. Direct Line shares proceeded to rally 7% to 252.2p at the time of writing. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, suggested that shareholders could push for a higher valuation, although “judging by recent City chatter, 275p should be enough to keep everyone happy and Aviva might be able to wrap this up fairly quickly”. “Aviva has performed every step of the takeover dance flawlessly. It’s spotted a rival going through a weak phase and thrown its hat into the ring as an interested buyer with a low-ball price to test the water. “It will have almost certainly known the first bid would have been rejected and it’s now come back with a higher and fairer offer, and Direct Line’s board has indicated it’s good enough. 10.41am: Morning commute chaos The morning commute was thrown into disarray this morning following a “nationwide fault” in National Rail’s communication system. Train drivers flagged a fault with the radio system, causing cancellations and delays as a manual solution was cobbled together. “There is a nationwide fault with the communication system used between train drivers and signallers. As a result, some services across the National Rail network may be subject to delays this morning,” National Rail said in a statement. “This issue is mainly affecting trains registering to enter their route for the start of service and deregistering to end their service. Once trains are underway, they are able to run normally at normal speeds. Short-notice cancellations and alterations are expected due to the knock-on effect on the timetables. Please check before you travel, allow extra time for your journey and monitor live departure boards.” The Northern, Elizabeth and South Western Railway lines are most affected, said Northern Rail. 10.14am: Berkeley shares down Shares in FTSE 100-listed hosuebuilder Berkeley Group Holdings PLC (LSE:BKG) are off more than 1.5% today following an interim trading update. In a statement, Berkeley disclosed that transaction volumes in the current 2025 financial year “remain around a third lower” than two years prior. Berkeley acknowledged that “whilst we have seen a slight uptick in recent weeks, a meaningful recovery will require a sustained improvement in consumer confidence and stability in the wider macroeconomic environment”. Berkeley saw a high-single-digit yearly decrease in pre-tax profit to £275.1 million and a 5.8% dip on basic earnings per share in the first half. Shares were trading at 4,096p each at the time of writing. 9.58am: Bitcoin falls from all-time high Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen sharply from the fresh all-time high achieved by the world’s largest cryptocurrency on Thursday. Bitcoin topped out at $104,000 late on Thursday evening before crashing more than 13% lower in the space of five hours. After bottoming out at $90,500, the BTC/USD pair has since settled at around $98,300, where it was trading on the spot markets at the time of writing. On Thursday, Trump announced the appointment of former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as his ‘White House A.I. & Crypto Czar’. An ardent Trump supporter who reportedly raised millions for the president-elect’s campaign, Sacks “will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness”, Trump wrote on Truth Social. 9.27am: Stamp duty deadline fuelling housing demand - analysts Demand for housing is being fuelled by hurried buying ahead of a drop in stamp duty thresholds next April, analysts have pointed out. Halifax on Friday reported a 4.8% jump in average house prices to a record £298,083 in the year to November, which marked the fastest growth since the same month in 2022. Analysts pointed to the looming deadline for a reversal in temporarily lifted stamp duty thresholds as a key reason behind surging demand. “Hesitation has turned to hurry in some parts of the market, especially among first-time buyers racing to complete their purchases before the stamp duty thresholds change,” Garrington Property Finders chief executive Jonathan Hopper commented. “This sense of urgency is prompting some buyers to view in haste and offer high in order to secure a home now and complete their purchase before the tax changes take effect.” The stamp duty threshold is due to fall from £250,000 to £125,000 come April 1 following confirmation in the Budget. First time buyers will pay the tax on properties worth over £300,000 in the meantime, against £425,000 previously. “It means property prices are likely to rise in the run-up to the deadline as buyers and sellers race to beat the tax hike,” Bestinvest analyst Alice Haine added. “Beyond the start of April, the market is likely to be more muted as buyers choose to purchase cheaper homes to reduce their tax bill or negotiate more aggressively to afford their desired property.” 9.06am: CBI scales back economic growth forecast after Budget The Confederation of British Industry has cut forecasts for UK economic growth and warned of investment and hiring setbacks in the wake of October’s Budget. Economic growth of 0.9% was predicted for 2024, against its previous forecast for 1.0%, while its expectation for next year was dialled down from 1.9% to 1.6%. “Measures in the autumn Budget will increase firms’ costs at a time when their profit margins have already been under pressure,” chief economist Louise Hellem said. “Many businesses have told us that these measures will likely push up prices and weigh on their hiring and investment plans going forward.” Inflation was forecast to average 2.6% through 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as the likes of hospitality and retail price growth provided upward pressure. 8.48am: Quiz sheds 50% after funding warning Quiz PLC (AIM:QUIZ) spiralled 50% on Friday after the omni-channel fashion firm warned it may need further funding early next year. Shares dropped 50.7% to 2.64p in the wake of the update, where Quiz pointed to a “marked decline” in both online and in-store traffic through November. Additional funding would likely be needed in early 2025 in “the absence of a material improvement to trading during the important pre-and-post-Christmas period,” Quiz said... Read more 8.35am: Direct Line surges, leads FTSE 250 higher Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) surged on Friday morning after accepting a takeover bid by Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.), leading the FTSE 250 higher. Shares jumped 7.8% to 253.64p in the wake of the news that it had agreed to the 275p per share offer. Molten Ventures PLC (LSE:GROW), Metro Bank Holdings PLC (LSE:MTRO) and Dr Martens PLC (LSE:DOCS) were also among those climbing on the FTSE 250. Overall, the index edged one point higher, placing it as an outlier in London early on while the likes of the FTSE 100, down 12 points, fell. 8.28am: Berkeley dips as transaction volumes slump Berkeley Group Holdings PLC (LSE:BKG) shares moved lower on Friday morning after the FTSE 100-listed housebuilder warned of a slump in transaction volumes. Transaction volumes in the current 2025 financial year “remain around a third lower” than two years prior, it said in an interim update. The company acknowledged that “whilst we have seen a slight uptick in recent weeks, a meaningful recovery will require a sustained improvement in consumer confidence and stability in the wider macroeconomic environment”... Read more Shares slipped 0.4% to 4,148p. 8.20am: Thames Water last-minute bid could see break-up, listing Thames Water has reportedly received a last-minute takeover bid which would see the UK’s largest water supplier broken up and listed on the stock exchange. British infrastructure investor Covalis tabled an offer ahead of Thursday’s deadline for indicative bids, according to the Financial Times. Some £1 billion would be paid upfront, before a further £4 billion was raised through sales of Thames’ assets, refinancing and a stock market listing. Billions of pounds worth of Thames’ assets could be sold, potentially including entire regions, as new owners worked to cut its near-£19 billion debt pile and stave off cash woes. France’s Suez had also penned a deal with Covalis to aid the break-up but would not own any shares, with the UK government set to receive a seat on Thames’ board. Hong Kong-based Northumbrian Water owner CK Infrastructure Holdings and Castle Water, co-owned by Conservative treasurer Graham Edwards, are also reportedly in the running as potential bidders for the crisis-hit supplier. 8.05am: FTSE 100 just on the front foot London’s blue chips racked up an ever-so-slight gain as trading got underway on Friday, climbing one point to 8,351. Banks were among those in the green early on in the absence of any major movers, while Spirax Group PLC and Frasers Group PLC (LSE:FRAS) led fallers. 7.59am: Direct Line agrees to boosted Aviva bid Direct Line Insurance Group PLC (LSE:DLG) has preliminary agreed to an enlarged takeover bid by Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.). The 275p per share offer represents a 73.3% premium to its closing price on November 27 and includes 129.7p in cash and the rest in new Aviva shares, plus a 5p dividend payment subject to board approval. Direct Line rejected the initial offer, with the motor and home insurer calling it a \"highly opportunistic” bid that “substantially undervalued the company\"... Read more 7.56am: Quiz warns further funding may be needed Quiz PLC (AIM:QUIZ) has warned it may need further funding by early next year after a drop in footfall and online traffic hit sales in recent months. Both online and in-store traffic suffered a “marked decline” during the important trading month of November, the omni-channel fashion firm said on Friday. Revenue slipped by £1.5 million to £24.9 million in its latest quarter as a result, and was down 8.6% over the eight months to November at £52.2 million. This was behind management’s expectations, with Quiz pointing to uncertainty around both the impact from November’s Black Friday and October’s Budget on trading. “In the absence of either a material improvement to trading during the important pre-and-post-Christmas period [...] the board anticipates that additional funding will be required by the group in the first quarter of 2025,” Quiz said. 7.25am: House prices new high after strongest growth in two years House prices have hit a new record high after November saw the strongest growth in two years. According to Halifax, the typical house now costs £298,083, after prices increased by 4.8% over the year to November for the largest uptick since the same month in 2022. Month on month, prices ticked up by 1.3%, marking the fifth consecutive positive reading. “Latest figures continue to show improving levels of demand for mortgages, as an easing in mortgage rates boost buyer confidence,” Halifax mortgages head Amanda Bryden said. Wider economic issues and pressed affordability threatened this, she warned, though positive employment data and further declines in mortgage rates should buoy demand. “This should underpin further house price growth, albeit at a modest pace as borrowing costs remain above the average of a few years ago,” Bryden added. 7.12am: Index to reverse on gains Futures had the FTSE 100 largely reversing on Thursday’s 13-point gain ahead of trading, with London’s blue-chip index seen 8 points lower at 8,355.

  "title": "The Blockchain Revolution In The Energy Market",
  "content": " panels on March 06, 2024 near Palm Springs, California. The proliferation of renewable energy sources has prompted a model of distributed generation, which blockchain can help facilitate. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Getty Images Blockchain is moving beyond cryptocurrencies. By 2026, the market for blockchain in the energy sector is set to exceed $1.5 billion—a massive leap from just $127.5 million in 2018. Energy companies see immense potential in this technology, including how it can transform everything from grid management to green energy trading. Blockchain is a digital technology that records transactions between parties and securely stores that information across a decentralized system. Multiple participants verify and record the information so it cannot be altered or tampered with. Although blockchain is best known as the key system behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it can be used for any secure transaction, and its applications in the energy sector are rapidly expanding. Today, the energy sector is evolving, and utilities are moving away from highly centralized systems—where energy is generated at large power plants and distributed to customers—and towards a more decentralized model. This model is often called “distributed generation.” The shift is driven by the growth of renewable energy sources and innovations like smart grids and electric vehicles. With more energy produced from rooftop solar panels or wind and hydro turbines, utilities are finding new ways to manage and distribute this decentralized power, and this is where blockchain plays a role. Blockchain allows for the sale of this extra energy to the local electric utility or to neighbors without needing a middleman. In this decentralized model, blockchain is the agent of connectivity that ensures secure and reliable energy transfers from one party to another. For example, rooftop solar panels can produce surplus electricity that goes unused by the host household and can be sold to other neighbors. This is called peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, and it is made possible by blockchain’s secure, transparent, and efficient transaction capabilities. One key benefit of blockchain technology in the energy sector is cost reduction. Traditional energy transactions often involve intermediaries, which adds to overall costs. By eliminating the middlemen, blockchain enables direct transactions between parties, reducing unnecessary fees and lowering consumer energy prices. It also facilitates more efficient systems for energy companies. Moreover, blockchain enhances security by providing a secure, unchangeable record of energy transactions. This helps create trust between producers and consumers. Knowing their contributions are being accurately tracked and rewarded will encourage more people to participate in green energy programs. The days of the “faulty meter” will soon be over. meter, part of a smart grid technology program from the California based public utility. Blockchain technology could soon bolster the efficacy of smart grids. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)Getty Images Blockchain technology encounters obstacles related to its public image, as many associate it with the energy-intensive cryptocurrency industry. Cryptocurrency mining, which relies on “proof of work” cryptography, is known for using vast quantities of energy to solve complex computational problems and produce more currency. Comparatively, the blockchain solutions being explored for energy applications use more energy-efficient methods, like “proof of stake.” This makes blockchain viable for utilities looking to improve efficiency without increasing their carbon footprint. For investors, blockchain in energy carries a risk and an opportunity. On the one hand, it is an evolving technology, and its adoption by grid operators may be slow, uneven, and unpredictable. On the other hand, blockchain can open up new revenue streams—such as selling renewable energy credits on a secure platform, thus incentivizing investment into the technology’s proliferation. Many companies are already investing in blockchain applications in the energy sector, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Google, Engie, Sun Exchange, Siemens, and Shell, to name a few. Looking ahead, blockchain combined with AI could create even more robust energy systems with AI using real-time data to predict energy needs as blockchain simultaneously tracks transactions, enabling a stable and consumer-centric grid that adapts to fluctuating demand. Wise and sophisticated legislation, modernized, user-neutral policies, and clear regulatory frameworks are essential for blockchain to become a fixture in the energy sector. The Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023 showcases a growing desire in Congress for the United States to take a more proactive role in leading the world in blockchain technology. Blockchain’s future in the energy sector looks increasingly promising. In Europe, the EU has already recognized the importance of regulatory frameworks for blockchain-based applications, including those in the energy sector. Blockchain is more than just a technology supporting cryptocurrency. It has the power to reshape energy markets, making them more decentralized, transparent, and efficient. As the long-term future moves towards cleaner energy and smarter grids, blockchain’s role is set to grow. The participation and support of the U.S. Government and corporations in adopting blockchain would allow the country to become a leader in this emerging industrial sector.

  "title": "Will the strong economy be a brake on further rate cuts ? ",
  "content": " As dawn broke over the United States, the financial world perched on the edge of its collective seat, awaiting the latest dispatch from the employment front. The November jobs report, a prelude to the Federal Reserve's policy rendezvous in a fortnight, delivered a pleasant surprise. How pleasant though? Nonfarm payrolls swelled by 227,000, outstripping the 220,000 predicted by the Bloomberg consensus of economists. The revelation marked a robust rebound from the hurricane and strike-dampened October figure of 12,000, while the unemployment rate nudged up to a still-svelte 4.2%, defying the 4.1% prophecy. Average hourly earnings progressed by 0.4% month-on-month while a 0.3% gain was expected. This muscular show of labor market health could give the Fed pause in its rate-cutting choreography, despite Jerome Powell's overtures to a more measured approach. But the market's crystal ball - the CME Fedwatch tool - still foresees a 91% likelihood of a rate trim at the December 18 Fed gathering. Before the labor market's latest act, U.S. equity futures had hinted at a subdued opening. Yet, in a swift volte-face post-release, the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq futures all inched up by a modest 0.1%, as if nodding in quiet approval. The inflation narrative will thicken next Wednesday with the consumer price index's next installment, expected to edge up from October's 2.6% - a subplot in the ongoing economic drama. On the corporate side, retailers Lululemon Athletica and Ulta Beauty paraded strong quarterly numbers, their pre-market shares pirouetting higher in response. Despite murmurs of overvaluation, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have been scaling new heights, with a 27% ascent since the year's dawn, seemingly on a quest to kiss the sky. Across the pond, he French stock market, the euro and French debt are resilient despite the fall of the government after a vote of no confidence. This is based on the gamble that France will be governable in the coming months, with limited damage to the economic and social apparatus. French President Emmanuel Macron said that he won’t resigned and explained yesterday on TV that parliamentarians were wrong for having censured the Barnier government, and that he will name the successor to the current Prime Minister “in the coming days”, calling for a “government of general interest”. Oil prices, meanwhile, took a bow, slipping as OPEC+ opted to delay its production encore. India's central bank conducted a delicate balancing act, holding rates steady while fine-tuning its economic forecasts and causing a slight tremor in its stock indices. China's markets, after a bout of jitters over stimulus stage fright, bounced back, buoyed by whispers of a central bank rate cut - the most dramatic in a decade, according to the Bloomberg grapevine. As the week's financial performance drew to a close, the Asia-Pacific markets mostly dipped, save for China's rebound. Europe, on the other hand, ended on a high note, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index taking a modest bow, up 0.2%.Economic highlights today: The big focus on the calendar today is on the US employment figures for November.

Today's top stories Syrian opposition forces stormed Hama city in central Syria yesterday as part of their largest offensive in years against President Bashar al-Assad's government. The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Omar Albam / AP / APSmoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing.

  "title": "Markets Wait For U . S . Payrolls Data",
  "content": " Market spotlight has now turned on the payrolls data due from the U.S. on Friday morning. Markets expect the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with conducting monetary policy to support the goals of maximum employment and stable prices to take cognizance of the price pressures emanating from the labor market. The unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 4.2 percent in November from 4.1 percent in the previous month. Markets also expect the addition to payrolls to record 200 thousand versus 12 thousand in the previous month. Average hourly earnings, another key labor market metric is expected to edge down on a monthly as well as yearly basis. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve, in its decision which is 12 days away is still expected to reduce rates. However, as shown in the CME FedWatch tool, the likelihood of a quarter-point Fed rate cut in December has decreased to 68 percent whereas the expected probability of a status quo has increased to 32 percent. Wall Street Futures are in mildly negative territory. European benchmarks are trading in the green zone. Asian benchmarks closed on a mixed note. The Dollar Index edged up.

  "title": "Ethereum to prove skeptics wrong with a new all - time high before Trump swearing - in , but the bigger story will be a 100x run from rival token",
  "content": " Ethereum’s 45% price increase since the November 5 election has sparked a debate about its ability to retest its all-time high of $4800. Many believe ETH’s present price of $3,600 will rise to a new high before Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. However, the bigger news is Rexas Finance, a new competitor with lofty aspirations and strong presale performance. Experts tip the coin to see a 17x run in the ongoing bull cycle. Rexas Finance (RXS): Ethereum’s rival with 17x potential Rexas Finance’s asset tokenization vision is making ripples on the blockchain. By converting real-world assets (RWAs) into blockchain-tradable digital tokens, Rexas Finance is transforming the trillion-dollar real estate, commodities, and art markets. Tokenization makes illiquid assets more accessible and allows global market involvement, boosting development potential. Rexas Finance is entering the tokenization sector and implementing AI, DeFi, and smart contracts. This diversified ecosystem facilitates token development, yield optimization, and decentralized exchanges. The Rexas Token Builder, Launchpad, and GenAI allow novices and experts to create and launch digital assets without coding. The ongoing RXS presales are incredible. Rexas Finance raised $20.75 million by completing eight stages in three months. At $0.125, Rexas Finance has sold 87% of the Stage 9 tokens. Rexas Finance’s presale success shows that its innovative concept is popular. The project has outpaced Ethereum in new features and use cases, making it a viable contender against ETH supremacy. After the presale, at least three top-ten exchanges will list the RXS token, increasing liquidity and investor confidence. Rexas Finance specializes in trillion-dollar marketplaces. Real estate is worth $379.7 trillion, while commodities will be worth $121.2 trillion by 2024. In these enormous marketplaces, Rexas Finance’s fractional ownership and smooth transaction technologies could create new opportunities. Analysts expect Rexas Finance to return 17x before ETH could reach a new all-time high, making it an attractive option for investors seeking bigger returns. Ethereum to Reach a New All-Time High Before Trump’s Swearing-In Meanwhile, Ethereum’s recent recovery was due to investor enthusiasm and good fundamentals. ETH’s current price of $3,600 is 25% lower than its all-time high of $4,878, but analysts expect it to surpass this level and maybe reach new highs before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, 2025. Superior open interest performance is expected to drive Ethereum’s growth. Ether’s open interest in futures contracts now exceeds Bitcoin’s, indicating institutional interest. Ether ETFs witnessed record daily inflows in late November 2024. Due to institutional demand and increased client interest, Ethereum may rise above $5,000 before the January deadline. Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin in futures yield. Shorter expiration dates for Ethereum futures are fetching a premium, a sign of elevated price expectations. Due to this enthusiasm, Bybit experts expect Ethereum to reach $5,000 before Trump’s inauguration. As regulatory uncertainty decreases, the crypto market becomes more optimistic. The resignation of US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler could result in improved crypto rules, therefore benefiting Ethereum. Given its potential to rebound to its all-time high and beyond, these factors suggest that Ethereum could be a top asset to monitor in early 2025. Conclusion Ethereum may achieve a new high before Trump’s inauguration. The real opportunity may be Rexas Finance, a revolutionary asset tokenization enterprise with tremendous growth potential. Rexas Finance’s presale performance might yield 17x returns, making it a 2025 must-invest. Rexas Finance offers investors a chance to profit from the next cryptocurrency boom. Get engaged and ready for the next crypto revolution as the project prepares for its next presale round and exchange listing.

  "title": "Ransomware Gang Merciless Attacks Bleed Small Companies Dry",
  "content": " The black-and-white message flickering across computer screens sparked panic at Knights of Old, a 158-year-old UK delivery company: “If you’re reading this, it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead.” Knights’ network for managing trucks was down. So was the system for booking payments. From 2,000 miles away, a criminal, Russia-linked hacking gang known as Akira had sabotaged the computers at Knights of Old and two related trucking companies. To force negotiations, the crooks in June 2023 had deployed malicious software that encrypted Knights’ files and then threatened to publish online its confidential internal data. Paying a ransom would get the company a decryption key that could be used to unlock the compromised computers and servers, Akira said. “For now, let’s keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue,” the gang wrote in a note on Knights’ infected machines. “We’re fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources.” In 2023 ransomware attacks rose 70% from a year earlier, to 4,611, according to the SANS Institute, a cyber­security research and training organization. Since March 2023, Akira alone has victimized more than 350 organizations and extorted an estimated $42 million, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Bloomberg analysis found. (The gang, which maintains a website, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) Akira has had some high-profile targets, such as Nissan Motor Co., Stanford University and Yamaha Motor Co. But ­cybersecurity researchers have found that about 80% of its victims are small and medium-size organizations, most in North America and Europe. “No business can ignore this threat, no matter how big or small,” says Paul Abbott, 58, Knights’ co-owner. According to digital insurance company Embroker, most smaller businesses set their policy limits for cyber­security damages at $1 million, close to the level at Knights. That money could potentially be used to pay a ransom and help rebuild infected computers. But it’s often nowhere near enough. The median ransom payment soared to $6.5 million in 2023, from $335,000 the year before, insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. found. Will Thomas, a cybersecurity expert who’s closely tracked Akira’s attacks, says the group identifies its targets by scanning the internet for servers that are operating outdated software, then opportunistically breaches them. “What they do is not particularly complicated or sophisticated,” Thomas says. “But they are very successful, and they are ruthless.” In 1865, William Knight started making deliveries in a horse and cart he drove through an English village called Old, about 80 miles north of London. Hence his company, now based in nearby Kettering, would come to be known as Knights of Old. Abbott, who grew up in the area, knew the Knight family, and at age 20 he joined Knights of Old. He worked first as a traffic manager, helping to route the trucks and supporting drivers and customers. Abbott steadily climbed the ranks, and around 2007 he and two business partners, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, became directors and then co-­owners. They later joined Knights of Old with two other delivery ­companies—Nelson Distribution Ltd. and Steve Porter Transport Ltd.—under the name KNP Group.By the time of the hack, KNP had almost £100 million ($126 million) in annual revenue, 900 employees, seven depots and 400 trucks. Knights was the biggest and best known of the three companies, its trucks bearing an image of an armored knight and a vivid color scheme of bright blue with huge yellow letters spelling out the motto “Service With Honour.” Among its customers were publishing giants Penguin Random House LLC and Hachette Book Group, which relied on its fleet to distribute millions of books for Amazon.com Inc. and other retailers. In early 2023, KNP leased a 140,000-square-foot warehouse in Luton, near London, as part of an expansion effort. Having experienced computer failures in the past, Abbott and his colleagues had already established an alternative way of working. They could revert to writing out paper tickets and job sheets for each delivery and use their mobile phones and Gmail. Abbott had thought the company was secure. Just a month before the intrusion, he’d arranged a £1 million cyberattack policy through the British insurer Aviva Plc, which declined to comment. Managers had also trained staff on cybersecurity awareness and were paying about £60,000 annually to a contractor that provided support. But following the attack, he says, the contractor—whom he declines to name—provided little help and “didn’t have a clue” what to do. After the initial attack, Aviva arranged for a team of experts from security company Solace Cyber to help. The following morning it began to digitally clean all electronic devices—computers, laptops, even photocopiers—that were connected to the company’s network. Paul Cashmore, Solace’s managing director and co-founder, says the breach had inflicted devastating damage. He recalled navigating Knights’ employees through a roller coaster of emotions. “First there was the shock. Then it’s realization. Then it’s dealing with the impact,” he says. Solace is currently working on about two major ransom­ware incidents every week, Cashmore says, and the pace shows no sign of slowing. Knights consulted US-based company Coveware Inc., which specializes in negotiating with ransomware hackers, Abbott says. The company, which declined to comment, told him that, based on KNP’s size and revenue, the Akira gang would likely expect a payment in Bitcoin worth $2.7 million to $5.3 million. Law enforcement agencies generally advise against paying ransoms because it incentivizes further attacks. Sending cryptocurrency to the gangs could also violate sanctions that are in place against some of the criminals involved. Abbott said he and his partners decided not to negotiate with Akira or pay the gang anything, because there could be no guarantee the data could be fully recovered even with the decryption key. In response the hackers followed through on their threat, publishing more than 10,000 internal documents online—mostly employee payroll files, invoices and other financial information.The company tried to rebuild its computers. Within a few days, Knights’ technicians had set up a new transport management system and recovered an old backup of the warehouse software. But the financial management databases couldn’t be immediately recovered, because hackers had destroyed another backup that was supposed to be stored securely elsewhere. Facing cash-flow pressures, KNP sought a loan. Abbott says the bank would provide it only if the company could supply the missing financial records and performance reports. Still waiting on a payout from the insurance company, the ­co-owners tried to sell the company. A European businessman came close to buying. But, because of the missing financial records, the buyer insisted that the three partners personally guarantee the state of the company’s finances. They’d be putting their houses and savings on the line. The partners balked, according to Abbott. “My wife would never have let me do that, regardless of how confident we were in the business,” he says. On Sept. 25, 2023, KNP Group entered administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy. In Kettering, Abbott announced the news to his employees, some of whom he’d worked with for decades. Another company bought one of KNP’s subsidiaries, Nelson Distribution, saving about 170 jobs. But the rest of KNP’s 700 or so employees, the majority of them from Knights of Old, lost their livelihood. Jeff Maslin, who drove trucks for Knights, says drivers are still owed weeks’ worth of wages. “I know people who lost their house, lost their car and ended up divorced,” he says. KNP later determined that Akira had gained access to the company’s systems using a technique called “brute forcing,” which can employ software that makes thousands or millions of guesses to discover a staffer’s password. Abbott says more sophisticated security monitoring software might have helped detect the intrusion. “If you haven’t got that, get it,” he advises other companies. Earlier this year, administrators began the process of selling Knights’ headquarters, along with KNP’s other assets. The fleet of trucks, mostly leased, has been returned. The insurer eventually paid out on the £1 million policy, but it didn’t cover Knights’ losses in administration. Abbott, now working as a consultant for other logistics companies, recently bought a single truck and plans to use it to start over. “I’ve had to rebuild my life,” he says. “I’ve lost everything.” Photograph: Co-owner of Knights of Old Paul Abbott; photo credit: Ryan Gallagher/Bloomberg Copyright 2024 Bloomberg."

  "title": "BlackRock , MARA Accumulate Nearly 10 , 000 BTC as Bitcoin Price Dips Below $100K",
  "content": " Key NotesBlackRock and MARA bought over 9,000 Bitcoin amid price dip.Institutions hold 2.66% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Despite recently experiencing a dip, Bitcoin BTC $99 317 24h volatility: 1.4% Market cap: $1.97 T Vol. 24h: $146.75 B has continued to draw interest from major institutions like BlackRock and MARA Holdings. The latest reports show that, between December 5 and 6, the giants BlackRock, MARA Holdings, alongside a yet-to-be-identified whale, collectively bought nearly 10,000 Bitcoin, taking advantage of the price fall to $92,957. BlackRock and MARA Lead the Bitcoin Accumulation Frenzy BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, made the most notable BTC purchase after scooping up 7,750 Bitcoin. This means that its total Bitcoin holdings now stand at $48.9 billion at current prices, per Arkham Intelligence data. Interestingly, BlackRock’s latest purchase comes at a time when shares of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) are also seeing increased demand. This surging interest in regulated ETFs goes to show that crypto may have found a place to stay, having gained mainstream recognition and acceptance. According to Thomas Fahrer, the founder of crypto markets firm Apollo, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is undoubtedly the “fastest-growing ETF ever.” MARA Holdings, on the other hand, secured 1,423 Bitcoin over four separate transactions. That is, between December 5 and 6. The Bitcoin mining firm spent $139.5 million in the process following the closure of MARA’s $850 million convertible note offering. As the company had earlier stated, the funds realized from the sale have been earmarked for Bitcoin accumulation. For now, MARA’s Bitcoin reserves stand at 22,108 Bitcoin and are worth around $2.17 billion. However, considering how it has seen a remarkable 162% increase in its holdings compared to last month, it is clear that the firm may have adopted an aggressive treasury strategy, which is obviously inspired by MicroStrategy. Whales and Other Players Join Buying Trend Like BlackRock and MARA, an unknown whale has also seized the opportunity of BTC price dip to acquire 600 more Bitcoin. Going by current prices, the move may have cost the account nearly $58.9 million. However, unlike BlackRock and the rest, blockchain data reveals that this account only recently began accumulating Bitcoin. That is, as its first transaction reportedly took place on November 24. Other firms that have taken Bitcoin as a treasury strategy include healthcare tech firm Semler Scientific. Semler also increased its Bitcoin holdings to 1,873. That is after purchasing 303 Bitcoin on December 4. Without a doubt, institutional and corporate players are now paying more attention to Bitcoin. They collectively hold 527,026 Bitcoin, which represents 2.66% of Bitcoin’s total supply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $97,821, down 4.83% over the past 24 hours. nextDisclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

  "title": "Bitcoin Reserve Would  Benefit Special Interest Groups , Former Fed Chairman Warns",
  "content": "Former chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bill Dudley on Friday voiced strong concerns over the United States potentially including Bitcoin BTC/USD in its national reserves, a proposal gaining momentum among crypto-friendly legislators. In an opinion piece, Dudley argues that such a move could harm the interests of the general public and compromise the dollar’s standing as the global reserve currency. He highlighted the potential downsides of establishing a government Bitcoin reserve, stating, “If the United States adopts Bitcoin as a reserve asset, it would likely benefit specific interest groups at the expense of the majority.” He also warned that such a strategy would be more about inflating Bitcoin’s value than delivering any tangible benefit to the government or citizens. Bitcoin, which recently surged past $100,000 following Donald Trump‘s election victory, is seen by some as a revolutionary asset. Proponents believe it could serve as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool in portfolios. However, Dudley criticized its role as money, describing its volatility and lack of income generation as fundamental flaws. “Bitcoin is not connected to any cash flows like interest or dividends, and its price is driven purely by speculative demand,” he explained. Also Read: Semler Scientific Expands Bitcoin Holdings To Over $180 Million With Latest Purchase Dudley pointed out the dangers of the U.S. government holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin and said if the Treasury borrows to fund Bitcoin purchases, it would drive up debt service costs. “Alternatively, if the Federal Reserve creates money for the same purpose, it risks fueling inflation,” he said, adding that these outcomes would negatively impact taxpayers and the broader economy. The former Fed chair also noted that the absence of an exit strategy for a Bitcoin reserve would make it a liability. “The government would end up holding tokens that produce no income, offering no real value to the majority of Americans,” he said. Instead of focusing on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Dudley called for the Trump administration to prioritize creating a robust regulatory framework for the crypto industry. He emphasized the need for clear rules to protect consumers, regulate stablecoins, and prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. “Crypto technology has the potential to improve the financial system,” Dudley said. “However, without strong guardrails, fraud and abuse will continue to undermine trust and hinder progress.” Read Next: Dave Portnoy Blames Winklevoss Twins For Confusing Him Into Selling Bitcoin Too Early Image: Shutterstock Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

  "title": "Bitcoin Weekly Forecast : Rise towards $120K or drop to $85K ? ",
  "content": " Bitcoin price hovers around $98,000 at the end of a week in which it surpassed the $100K milestone to correct sharply afterward. BTC institutional demand and whale accumulation remain strong, supporting Bitcoin’s rally. Traders should be cautious due to the move of funds from Mt.Gox, US government transfers, and holders booking profits. Bitcoin (BTC) ends the working week hovering around $98,000 after a very volatile Thursday when it surpassed the $100K milestone and underwent a sharp correction. Strong institutional demand, whale accumulation, and the choice of a pro-crypto figure to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fueled the rally this week. However, traders should be cautious about a possible correction ahead as on-chain data shows holders booking profits at the top. Moreover, any moves from Mt.Gox funds and US government transfers could add to the selling pressure. Bitcoin institutional demand, whale accumulation remain strong Bitcoin surged past the $100K milestone on Thursday, reaching a peak of $104,088 before experiencing a sharp drop to $90,500. It ultimately recovered to close above $96,900. As of Friday, it is trading slightly above $98,000. This week, institutional demand supported Bitcoin’s rally. According to Coinglass, Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) data saw an inflow totaling $2.4 billion until Thursday, compared to a $136.5 million outflow last week. If this inflow trend persists or accelerates, it could provide additional momentum to the ongoing Bitcoin price rally. Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflow chart. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings has added more BTC this week. According to data from the crypto intelligence tracker Arkham, MARA holdings increased from 17,000 BTC on Monday to 22,000 BTC on Friday, bringing its total holding to an amount worth $2.17 billion. The potential incorporation of Bitcoin as a reserve asset by firms like MARA is good news for Bitcoin as it shows increasing adoption from big players. MARA BTC holdings chart. Source: Arkham As Bitcoin dropped from $100K on Thursday, a whale seized the opportunity and bought 600 BTC worth $58.85 million, according to Lookonchain data. Over the past two weeks, this whale has accumulated 1,300 BTC, worth $127 million. More optimistic signs for Bitcoin Multiple optimistic news and events have supported BTC’s rise towards the $100K milestone this week. Starting with Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, who delivered a presentation to Microsoft’s board on why the tech giant should buy Bitcoin. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor said. Microsoft’s shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to add BTC to its balance sheet on December 10, according to a report from QCP Capital. “If the proposal passes, it would be bullish not only for BTC but also for their other investments,” the report notes. Wednesday’s announcement of who would be the new chair of the US SEC added more bullish momentum to Bitcoin. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that he had nominated Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners, to take the role. This announcement positively impacted the market as Atkins is considered pro-crypto. On the same day, Bitcoin also got the endorsement of another prominent figure: Vladimir Putin. “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody. And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody,” the Russian President said on Wednesday at an investment forum in Moscow, according to a Watcher.Guru Twitter post. Some bearish signs to watch for After BTC rallied above the $100K mark this week, the COO of Bitget Wallet, Alvin Kan, told FXStreet that he expects a “healthy correction” shortly. “As market volatility could continue to increase, users should be cautious about leverage in futures contracts to avoid liquidation risks from sudden downturns. After the correction, it’s important to focus on sector rotation, as altcoin seasons are likely to continue,” Kan said. Profit-taking is another short-term risk for Bitcoin price after the recent rally. Santiment’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator suggests holders book profits at the top. BTC’s NPL metric spiked on Thursday, indicating that holders are, on average, selling their bags at a significant profit. A similar spike was seen on November 21, which led to a correction of over 7% in the next five days. If history repeats, BTC could see a similar fall in the short term. BTC NPL chart. Source: Santiment According to data from crypto intelligence tracker Arkham, a wallet related to the US government, moved on Monday 10K BTC worth $962.88 million from the Silk Road seized address to Coinbase Prime. On Tuesday, the US government wallet carried out a similar move, which moved many altcoins like Ethereum, Compound, Axie Infinity, and others worth $33.59 million into new wallets. Moreover, as BTC prices rose to six figures on Thursday, defunct exchange Mt.Gox transferred 24,052 BTC worth $2.43 billion to a new wallet, according to Lookonchain data. Similarly, on Friday, the Mt. Gox wallet transferred 3,620 BTC worth $352.69 million to two new wallets. If any of the above wallets intend to sell or distribute these coins, they can create bearish sentiment as market participants anticipate increased supply. Technical outlook: BTC rise toward $120K or a drop to $85K? Bitcoin price broke above the $100K milestone, reaching a high of $104,088, then fell sharply to make a daily low of $90,500 but recovered and closed above $96,900 on Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers around $98,000. Despite the recovery from Thursday’s fall, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) flashes warning signs. The higher high formed on Thursday does not reflect the RSI chart for the same period, indicating a formation of a bearish divergence, which often leads to a short-term correction. If this bearish divergence plays out, traders could expect a small rise towards the recent high of $104,088 (grabbing liquidity or trapping longs), to then fall sharply towards the $90,000 support level. A successful close below this level could extend an additional decline towards the next support level of $85,000. BTC/USDT daily chart Conversely, if BTC continues its uptrend and closes above $104,088, it could extend the rally towards the new all-time high of $119,510, a level that aligns with the 141.4% Fibonacci extension line drawn from the November 4 low of $66,835 to Thursday’s all-time high of $104,088. Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

  "content": " Bitcoin hit a big milestone: On Wednesday night, the digital currency's price crossed the six-figure threshold for the first time. As of Friday morning, that number hovered around $99,000 according to CoinMetrics. Throughout the day on Thursday, though, the value rose as high as $103,844. Here's how much a $1,000 investment in bitcoin made one, five or 10 years ago would be worth based on the digital currency's Dec. 5 midmorning price of $101,564, according to CNBC calculations. If you invested one year ago Percentage change: 130% Total as of Dec. 5: $2,305 If you invested five years ago Percentage change: 1,272% Total as of Dec. 5: $13,717 If you invested 10 years ago Percentage change: 26,738% Total as of Dec. 5: $268,384 Here's how that compares with the S&P 500 index, which is often viewed as a benchmark of the overall stock market. Percentage change since one year ago: 33% Percentage change since five years ago: 95% Percentage change since 10 years ago: 193% What prompted bitcoin to hit its new all-time high Money Report One potential reason behind the surge may be some of Wall Street's key institutions' embrace of bitcoin. Several large investment firms including Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity Investments launched the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in January. Since an ETF tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, bitcoin ETFs provide a way to invest, and benefit from potential price movements, without owning the cryptocurrency itself. With the availability of bitcoin ETFs, a larger number of investors can gain access to bitcoin. And as demand rises, so does the price, Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council, told CNBC Make It on January 5. Bitcoin's value has fluctuated wildly over the past few years. The virtual currency hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, only to lose around 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX, the largest crypto exchange at the time, in November 2022. Since then, though, it has made a steady recovery and is up around 125% year over year, per CoinMetrics. Cryptocurrency remains highly volatile While bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, all crypto isn't bitcoin. Experts warn against attempting to predict how other cryptocurrencies or meme coins may behave based on bitcoin's price movements. Cryptocurrencies are considered speculative assets and are prone to unexpected surges and drops in value. Unlike stocks, which represent partial ownership in a company, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by an underlying asset. That's why experts often warn against investing more than you're willing to lose. If you want to \"try your luck\" with crypto investing, consider opting for buying a bitcoin ETF through your brokerage account, James Royal, Bankrate's principal investing and wealth management analyst, told CNBC Make It in May. \"The annual fees are reasonable, cheaper in most cases than actually buying the crypto yourself, and you're buying a coin that has the interest of institutional investors, so demand may remain robust,\" he said. If you feel you must have crypto in your portfolio, make it a small portion of your investments, Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut, told CNBC Make It in January. \"I'd say 1% on the more conservative side, and no more than 5% of your total portfolio if you're a growth-focused investor,\" Vendig said.

All three benchmark indexes traded in the green, while bond yields dipped.Hiring was strong last month, rebounding from a much weaker-than-expected payroll figure in October.

  "title": "TikTok And Gen Z Fuel XRP Rise Amid Legal Optimism And Whale Moves",
  "content": " illustration, the XRP logo seen displayed on a smartphone with stock market graphs in the background. (Photo Illustration by Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images The most popular video platform garnered billions of views under the #XRP hashtag in November and December, with some influencers suggesting the price of the token could reach $10,000, as retail investors navigated FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) triggers. This week, Ripple’s XRP briefly claimed the spot as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, trailing only bitcoin and ethereum, after a 400% price rally over the past month. The resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler sparked expectations that Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC could soon end in the company’s favor. Driven by the positive sentiment, in recent weeks, XRP whale holders (addresses holding over 1 million XRP) have accumulated more than $1.12 billion worth of XRP, according to on-chain indicators. Whales Lead The Charge, But Retail Investors Become More Prominent However, it’s not just the whales driving XRP’s value. Crypto has become Gen Z’s most common investment, according to a survey from Policygenius earlier this year. Their Financial Planning Survey, which polled around 4,000 Americans, revealed crypto as the most preferred asset for the first time ever. On top of that, while bearish sentiment for XRP lingered through the 2021 bull run, the coin remained one of Gen Z’s top picks, surpassing bitcoin and ethereum as the top choice in some locations, such as South Korea. “It is hard to believe that these whales are Tiktokers. However, the hype created by the trends on TikTok helps to bring additional retail liquidity to the market. It's certainly helping to drive excitement and mindshare for XRP,” says Nic Puckrin from Coin Bureau. Another recent survey of over 1000 crypto holders, conducted by Kraken in December, confirmed that social media emerged as a major factor influencing trading behavior, with 85% of respondents reporting significant portfolio impacts from emotional trades. Retail investors, fueled by virality on social media platforms, are becoming an increasingly prominent force behind the cryptocurrency surge. While a single retail investor may not move the market, when large numbers of them accumulate, it can deeply impact the market — just as the GameStop surge did in 2021 on the traditional stock market. TikTok Effect On Retail Investors Influencers have been pushing XRP as a hot pick in the wake of bitcoin's price movement, gaining the most mentions under the #crypto hashtag for a brief period. Some popular videos published in November under the #XRP hashtag predict XRP could reach $10,000. Another psychological factor is that buying XRP for under $2 feels more accessible to Gen Z than accumulating ether or bitcoin, which are priced much higher. For many beginners, there is a notion that the cheaper an asset is, the better its chances to grow. “TikTok relies on short but engaging content, which is ideal for simplifying information, such as about investing in XRP cryptocurrency. Influencers promoting XRP as the “next big thing” can quickly reach millions of people, creating a ripple effect. The hashtags #XRP and #crypto are like a signal to an audience driven by FOMO, especially for young traders trying to rise to the top of their niche,” says Alexander Sharilov from CoinDataFlow. Active TikTok users often discuss the platform’s FOMO effect, driven by its algorithms that make it a breeding ground for viral trends. Once the algorithm detects your interest in a particular topic, it continually feeds you more content related to it, amplifying the FOMO until you're compelled to take action. “This massive exposure has created a sense of urgency among retail investors and a 'let's do it' attitude, leading to increased buying activity. The viral nature of TikTok content means that investment trends can spread rapidly, amplifying their impact on asset prices”, says Maxim Manturov from Freedom24. Some analysts predict the XRP price will surpass its 2017 bull run all-time high in 2025. As Gen Z continues to accumulate more wealth, TikTok’s influence could become even more prominent in shaping retail investment choices. So while investors typically turn to X (formerly Twitter) when discussing crypto and trading, TikTok is becoming an increasingly important force in influencing financial decisions with hundreds of thousands of posts with millions of views affecting minds like never before. \"TikTok’s algorithm is designed to promote content that resonates with users, and as XRP gained attention, it quickly spread to new audiences eager to invest,\" Maxim Manturov, Head of Investment Research at Freedom24, highlights how TikTok’s algorithm fosters viral trends: \"For retail investors, the allure of quick, viral success on platforms like TikTok is undeniable.\" While large holders of XRP have helped drive the cryptocurrency's current market position, Gen Z’s influence is increasingly shaping new crypto investment trends—far beyond memecoins. By promoting XRP as an investment option to millions of engaged users, TikTok has the ability to hold a surge in demand.

  "content": " Fernando Gutierrez-Juarez/picture alliance via Getty Images(NEW YORK) -- The price of bitcoin dropped below $100,000 late Thursday, just a day after topping the milestone for the first time.The world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to slide in early trading on Friday, before recovering some of the losses.The turmoil for bitcoin did not appear to impact other major crypto coins. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed nearly 5% in early trading on Friday, exceeding $4,000 for the first time since March.The turn of fortune for bitcoin interrupted a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump, who is viewed as friendly toward cryptocurrency.Since Election Day, the price of bitcoin has climbed nearly 50%. That performance far outpaces the S&P 500, which has risen about 5% over the same period.Bitcoin has proven highly volatile since its launch about 15 years ago.As recently as 2021, bitcoin suffered a downturn that cut its value in half. The same thing happened a year earlier, when the initial outset of the pandemic triggered a panic among investors.“As long as the narrative stays positive, there’s always room to grow,” Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, told ABC News before bitcoin reached $100,000.“It’s still a highly volatile asset,” Armour added.A surge had propelled bitcoin past $100,000 late Wednesday, just hours after Trump nominated crypto booster Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, the CEO of consulting firm Patomak Partners, serves as co-chair of the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.Once a crypto critic, Trump has vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump has also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.In a post on Truth Social early Thursday, Trump took credit for the gains: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!.”Trump has not spoken publicly about bitcoin since it fell below $100,000.Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved. "

  "content": " Stocks slipped from their records as investors await Friday's jobs report. President-elect Donald Trump tapped David Sacks to be an AI and crypto \"czar.\" Shares of Ulta and Lululemon rose after the retailers reported earnings beats. Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day: 1. Record slip Stocks moved lower Thursday, retreating from the records the major indexes hit in the previous trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 248.33 points, or 0.55%, while, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.18% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.19%. Bitcoin, meanwhile, also traded a bit lower, falling below $100,000 after it climbed above that threshold for the first time late Wednesday. Follow live market updates. 2. Jobs time Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHiring signage displayed at a job and resource fair hosted by the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board in partnership with NCWorks in Hendersonville, North Carolina, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024. It's the first Friday of December, which means it's time for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report. Investors will be watching to see if the jobs report gives a clearer picture of the labor market after a month that was muted by strikes and storms. Friday's report is expected to show an increase of 214,000 jobs in November, which would be a significant jump from October's underwhelming 12,000 gain. It will also give the Federal Reserve a sign of the economy ahead of its next policy meeting. Money Report 3. Retail rallies Shares of Ulta and Lululemon popped after the companies reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Ulta also raised its full-year outlook slightly as the beauty retailer shook off fears that the company was facing increasing competition and slowing demand for makeup and skincare. Lululemon, meanwhile, offered holiday guidance that was in line with expectations as the yoga pants retailer expressed some caution with the company's fourth quarter outlook. 4. Boeing boomerang David Ryder | ReutersBoeing 737 Max fuselages sit on railcars during an ongoing strike by the company's factory workers in Seattle, Washington, U.S., October 30, 2024. A federal judge rejected Boeing's plea deal tied to two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, citing concerns with the Justice Department's diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Boeing had agreed in July to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge and to pay a $243.6 million fine after the DOJ said the manufacturer violated an earlier agreement. Lawyers for victims' family members had criticized the plea deal and wanted to have more say in the selection of a monitor to oversee the company. 5. Sacks taps Paul Chinn | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers via Getty ImagesZenefits CEO David Sacks speaks at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, Calif. President-elect Donald Trump has named an artificial intelligence and crypto \"czar.\" He tapped venture investor and podcaster David Sacks for the role in a post on social media Thursday, noting that Sacks would \"steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.\" It was a sign that Trump is rewarding prominent tech tycoons who supported his campaign. Sacks had been a big financial backer for Trump during his 2024 campaign despite criticizing him after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. — CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han, Pia Singh, Jeff Cox, Leslie Josephs, Melissa Repko, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

  "title": "House Financial Services alum rejoins BGR Group",
  "content": " BGR Group is bringing back Matt Hoffmann three years after he left the lobbying giant to become the Republican staff director for the House Financial Services Committee. As a principal and the new co-head of the firm’s financial services practice group, Hoffmann will focus on cryptocurrency and digital assets regulation, banking, capital markets and the next iteration of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Investment Act (TCJA), a top priority for Republicans with several provisions set to expire in 2026. BGR Group Chairman and CEO Bob Wood called Hoffmann — also a former policy director at the Senate Finance Committee and senior adviser to former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) on the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees — “a tremendous asset to our firm and our clients as we navigate upcoming tax and financial services policy debates.” During his time as chief adviser to House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of the many things Hoffmann said he was “lucky” to have worked on was the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill to pass the chamber earlier this year. “I think that the the environment for productive, substantive policy development, bringing traditional finance and the crypto industry closer together,” Hoffmann told The Hill. “Now is the time for that work.” Crypto has been on a tear since Trump won and began appointing industry-friendly regulators to key positions in the incoming administration. Bitcoin broke $100,000 for the first time this week after the president-elect announced his pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When asked about the possibility of comprehensive crypto legislation being signed into law over the next two years, Hoffmann described himself as an “eternal optimist.” “I am optimistic that we’re gonna get something over the finish line,” he said. When Hoffmann briefly joined the blockchain technology company Digital Asset this summer as director of regulatory and government affairs, McHenry praised him for helping “Committee Republicans achieve our objectives while maintaining the bipartisanship necessary to secure lasting results.” McHenry is retiring at the end of this Congress, but Hoffmann didn’t seem worried about the upcoming leadership transition on the committee. “The senior leadership on that committee is exceptional. They have been involved in the space for a very long time and all of them were intimately involved in not just the crypto legislation, but our national security stuff, our banking regulations, the banking work that we did,” he said.

This week, malicious npm versions targeted Solana users, Brazilian banking giant entered cryptocurrency trading, a Nebraska man pleaded guilty to cryptojacking in Brooklyn federal court, Australia tightened rules for crypto businesses and crypto losses in 2024 dropped 15%. Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin said it will cease operations.See Also: OnDemand | NSM-8 Deadline July 2022:Keys for Quantum-Resistant Algorithms Implementation Malicious npm Versions Target Solana Users Cybersecurity researchers uncovered a supply chain attack targeting the widely used @solana/web3.js npm package, which helps developers interact with the Solana blockchain. Researchers from Socket found two malicious versions, 1.95.6 and 1.95.7, containing code designed to steal private keys and drain cryptocurrency wallets. The affected package, downloaded over 400,000 times weekly, has since been removed from the npm registry. The attack allegedly occurred after attackers compromised the npm account of the package's maintainers through a phishing attack. The malicious code in these versions of the package added a backdoor that exfiltrated private keys via seemingly legitimate CloudFlare headers, sending them to a remote server. This breach targeted projects handling private keys, such as decentralized applications, but did not impact non-custodial wallets that don’t expose private keys during transactions. Users of the package are advised to update to the latest secure version and rotate their keys if compromised. Brazilian Banking Giant Enters Cryptocurrency Trading Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco, launched cryptocurrency trading services on Monday through its investment platform. Clients of Brazil's largest bank can initially trade Bitcoin and Ether, with plans to expand offerings as crypto regulations evolve, said Guto Antunes, head of digital assets. Founded in 1924 Itau Unibanco manages over $526 billion in total assets and will safeguard customers' digital assets through its in-house custody services, according to BeinCrypto. The move positions Itau to compete with local players like MB and BTG Pactual's Mynt and global giants such as Binance. Itau distinguishes itself by acting as a custodian, safeguarding users' digital assets. The launch follows recent exits by Brazilian firms XP and PicPay, highlighting regulatory uncertainties in the country’s growing cryptocurrency market. CP30 Pleads Guilty to Cryptojacking A Nebraska man who stole $3.5 million worth of cloud computing services to mine just under a million dollars worth of cryptocurrency plead guilty Thursday to wire fraud in Brooklyn federal court.Prosecutors indicted the man, Charles O. Parks III - known online as \"CP30\" - with six criminal counts. Parks ran a cryptojacking operation from January 2021 through August of that year, using a variety of names, corporate affiliations and email addresses to register accounts with cloud providers. He created email domains for two corporate entities he created in the names of \"MultiMillionaire LLC\" and \"CP3O LLC.\" He laundered the cryptocurrency through exchanges, a non-fungible token marketplace, an online payment provider and traditional bank accounts. Once converted into dollars, Parks used the ill-gotten gains on purchases including a Mercedes Benz luxury car, jewelry and first-class hotel and travel expenses. He faces up to two decades in prison in sentencing. Australia Tightens Rules for Crypto Businesses The Australian Securities and Investments Commission proposed stricter licensing requirements for crypto businesses to enhance consumer protection and market integrity. Released through Consultation Paper 381, the updates clarify existing financial product definitions, including 13 examples illustrating their application to digital assets. ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland emphasized the balance between fostering responsible financial innovation and ensuring consumer confidence. The advisory also outlines transitional approaches for businesses adapting to the new framework. Stakeholders have until Feb. 28, 2025, to provide feedback. The final guidance is expected in mid-2025, shaping the future of Australia's crypto industry. Crypto Losses in 2024 Drop 15% Cryptocurrency losses in 2024 reached nearly $1.49 billion across 209 incidents, marking a 15% decrease compared to $1.75 billion in the same period last year, according to Immunefi’s Crypto Losses Report. Hacks remained the primary cause, accounting for 99.96% of the losses, while rug pulls made up a small fraction. May and July saw the highest losses, with over $359 million and $282 million, respectively. November reported $71 million in losses, mainly affecting DeFi projects like Thala Labs and DEXX. The BNB Chain was the most targeted, suffering 46.7% of attacks. DMM Bitcoin to Shut Down Operations Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin announced it will cease operations and transfer its assets to SBI VC Trade Co., a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, by March 2025. The move follows a major hack in May, which led to the loss of 4,502.9 bitcoins, worth approximately $303 million. SBI VC Trade plans to take over DMM Bitcoin’s 14 cryptocurrency trading offerings before the asset transfer. Both companies are finalizing details, including the transfer method and timeline. DMM Bitcoin, part of the DMM Group, stated the decision aims to prevent further customer inconvenience as investigations into the hack continue.

  "title": "Hawk Tuah girl : Online star faces crypto coin criticism",
  "content": "Getty ImagesHaliey Welch, known mostly as the star of the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" meme, is facing criticism after her newly launched cryptocurrency nosedived in value.Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.She added that no \"KOL\" (key opinion leaders) were gifted a free token.Ms Welch had previously distributed free Hawk tokens to some fans ahead of the launch across social media.Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain at around 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, and its market capitalisation soared to highs of $490m shortly after.However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.A community note on Ms Welch's X post contests her explanation, saying her team had been selling their Hawk coins since launch.Scam allegationsCoffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, also claimed that Hawk gave \"insiders\" an advantage.\"Unfortunately with situations like this, they're not targeting crypto bros, they're mostly targeting actual fans who have never been involved in the crypto space before,\" he said in a video viewed more than 1.4 million times.He accused Ms Welch's team of \"profiting from a rug pull\". \"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.Ms Welch's post on X claimed that her team attempted to prevent so-called \"snipers\", who buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly at moments when they are likely to make the most money from a gap in buy and sell price - sometimes using automated trading tools - by imposing higher fees on one exchange.The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post. It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.More recently, YouTuber Logan Paul was accused of misleading fans by promoting crypto coins or investments without divulging his own financial interest in them.Who is 'Hawk Tuah Girl' Haliey Welch?Known online as the \"Hawk Tuah girl\", Ms Welch went viral after speaking the onomatopoeia \"hawk tuah\" - imitating the sound of someone spitting - during an interview in June.It made the 22-year-old, from Belfast, Tennessee, an overnight internet sensation. She amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across various social platforms and launched her own merchandise and a podcast called \"Talk Tuah\".Getty ImagesMs Welch, who often wears a cowboy hat and boots, was mimicked in a Saturday Night Live sketch in September by Chloe FinemanHer manager told the Hollywood Reporter in July that she was unique in not having sought out internet fame, having been off social media for mental health reasons for several months before appearing in the now-viral \"Hawk Tuah\" video. Rolling Stone has likened her funny, small-town personality to a \"Gen Z Dolly Parton\".

  "title": "Baystreet . ca - Trump Names Venture Capitalist David Sacks U . S .  Crypto Czar  ",
  "content": " U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has named venture capitalist and podcast host David Sacks to be the country’s new “Crypto Czar.” On social media, Trump said that Sacks will join his White House administration in the newly created role of “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” This means that Sacks will spearhead the Trump administration’s policies for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. One of Sacks first tasks will reportedly be to create a legal framework for crypto such as Bitcoin (BTC), as well as leading a presidential council of advisors on science and technology. Sacks was a major Trump supporter during the U.S. election campaign, hosting a fundraiser at his San Francisco mansion that charged $50,000 U.S. per person to attend. However, Sacks has been critical of Trump in the past, notably after the Capitol Hill riot in January 2021. Sacks said on his “All-In” podcast that Trump was “clearly” responsible for the events of January 6, and that he had “disqualified himself from being a candidate at a national level.” However, by this summer, Sacks was speaking at the Republican National Convention and raising money to get Trump re-elected. Besides his podcast, Sacks is a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who sold Yammer to Microsoft (MSFT) for $1.2 billion U.S. back in 2012. He’s also a member of the so called “PayPal mafia,” a group of prominent technology figures, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who founded and grew PayPal (PYPL) in the 1990s. The price of Bitcoin has pulled back to trade at $98,000 U.S. after rising to a record high of $103,000 U.S. in recent days. "

  "title": "Hawk Tuah girl : Online star faces crypto coin criticism",
  "content": "Haliey Welch, known mostly as the star of the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" meme, is facing criticism after her newly launched cryptocurrency nosedived in value.Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X , external(formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.She added that no \"KOL\" (key opinion leaders) were gifted a free token.Ms Welch had previously distributed free Hawk tokens to some fans ahead of the launch across social media.Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain at around 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, and its market capitalisation soared to highs of $490m shortly after.However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.A community note on Ms Welch's X post contests her explanation, saying her team had been selling their Hawk coins since launch.Coffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, also claimed that Hawk gave \"insiders\" an advantage.\"Unfortunately with situations like this, they're not targeting crypto bros, they're mostly targeting actual fans who have never been involved in the crypto space before,\" he said in a video viewed more than 1.4 million times.He accused Ms Welch's team of \"profiting from a rug pull\". \"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.Ms Welch's post on X claimed that her team attempted to prevent so-called \"snipers\", who buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly at moments when they are likely to make the most money from a gap in buy and sell price - sometimes using automated trading tools - by imposing higher fees on one exchange.The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post, external. It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.More recently, YouTuber Logan Paul was accused of misleading fans by promoting crypto coins or investments without divulging his own financial interest in them.Known online as the \"Hawk Tuah girl\", Ms Welch went viral after speaking the onomatopoeia \"hawk tuah\" - imitating the sound of someone spitting - during an interview in June.It made the 22-year-old, from Belfast, Tennessee, an overnight internet sensation. She amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across various social platforms and launched her own merchandise and a podcast called \"Talk Tuah\".Her manager told the Hollywood Reporter in July, external that she was unique in not having sought out internet fame, having been off social media for mental health reasons for several months before appearing in the now-viral \"Hawk Tuah\" video. Rolling Stone has likened her funny, small-town personality to a \"Gen Z Dolly Parton\". Ms Welch told outlet TMZ ahead of Hawk's launch on Wednesday that she launched it to tackle \"a bunch of imposters\" pretending to be her and selling their own coins.\"It's a really good way to get all my fans and community to interact and come together,\" she said."

  "title": "Stock market today : Wall Street rises after solid jobs data boosts chances for a coming rate cut",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter.Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.

  "title": "Tech billionaires at war with Biden as debanking row goes stateside",
  "content": "When Coutts threatened to close the bank account of Nigel Farage last year, the fallout claimed the scalp of one of Britain’s most senior banking executives and triggered a national debate over “debanking”.Was it really acceptable for a bank to close the accounts of customers seemingly without warning, explanation or recourse? And were the decisions motivated by politics?Now, anger over debanking is picking up steam across the Atlantic. Technology billionaires, many of whom supported Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, accuse the Biden administration of cutting them off from the US banking system.Executives, primarily drawn from the cryptocurrency industry, have railed against what they have dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” – an alleged government effort to smother their businesses by making it almost impossible to maintain a formal banking presence.“This is one of the reasons we ended up supporting Trump,” Marc Andreessen, the billionaire co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, told the podcaster Joe Rogan last week. “We’ve had, like, 30 founders debanked in the last four years.”Over the last week, these claims have been amplified by billionaire Trump supporters, including Elon Musk, as well as dozens of cryptocurrency and tech founders. They allege they have been cut off from the US banking system by the Biden administration and government watchdogs.David Marcus, a former Facebook executive who led the tech giant’s Libra digital currency project, claimed its plans were “killed” by top government officials, including Janet Yellen, Biden’s Treasury Secretary. “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100pc a political kill,” he claimed in a post on X.Target political opponentsThe alleged debanking of crypto entrepreneurs comes amid a years-long crackdown on digital currency business and their billionaire founders. Under the Biden administration, US regulators have unleashed a series of civil and criminal lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges.Those prosecuting such cases claim they are simply enforcing regulation or crackdown on wrongdoing.Yet critics claim it is part of a broader effort to target political opponents. Andreessen claimed that it is not only businesses that have been impacted, but “just generally political opponents”.In her book, Melania Trump, the former first lady, claimed her bank account and that of her son Barron were shut down in the wake of the Jan 6 riots. “This decision appeared to be rooted in political discrimination,” she wrote.Melania and Barron claimed her, and her son’s Barron, bank accounts were shut down in the wake of the Jan 6 riots - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North AmericaFarage’s fury toppled Alison Rose, Britain’s most senior female banker and the ultimate boss of Coutts, in a victory for the Reform UK leader.However, US cryptocurrency executives claim their anger has been channelled towards even more powerful ends: winning the White House.In the technology industry, the crackdown has prompted many billionaire cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to become funders of the Republican Party’s election efforts.Crypto donors spent $245m (£192m) backing pro-cryptocurrency candidates, largely Republicans. One crypto-funded political action committee spent $40m alone to defeat Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator for Ohio.Trump has seemingly repaid the industry for their support, naming Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency lobbyist, as his nominee to chair the US Security and Exchange Commission.On Thursday, Trump claimed responsibility for helping to drive a surge in the price of Bitcoin to $100,000, posting “You’re welcome” to his followers on Truth Social.Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, the $80bn cryptocurrency trading app, said in a post on X the crackdown on cryptocurrency companies was one of the most “un-American things that happened in the Biden administration” and “a major factor in the Dems losing the election”.Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech lobbying group Chamber of Progress, says: “I’ve heard directly from crypto-founders at conferences and round tables who view ‘debanking’ as a key driver of their political advocacy.“Many in the industry see this issue as a motivating factor behind their support for incoming president Donald Trump, hoping his administration can reset regulatory relations with the crypto and blockchain sectors.”Andreessen, whose venture firm is an investor in Coinbase, and others have compared “Operation Choke Point 2.0” to a previous Obama-era scandal known as “Operation Choke Point”. This involved US justice officials pushing banks to close accounts used by legal – if politically controversial – customers, such as sex workers, gun dealers or legal marijuana shops.After Trump’s victory in 2016, the programme was shut down. But the cryptocurrency industry believes the initiative was reheated on Biden’s watch, in what Armstrong called an attempt to “unlawfully kill our entire industry”.In June, Coinbase hired a research firm to sue the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the US banking agency, accusing it of having “pressured financial institutions to cut off the industry from the banking system”.It has accused the regulator of sending so-called “pause letters” to banks, ordering them to halt crypto related activity indefinitely. After its efforts to reveal these documents using Freedom of Information laws were blocked, the regulator was sued.The lawsuit claims: “It is illegal for financial regulators to coerce regulated institutions in secret to cut ties with businesses the government disfavours.”John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says the “supposed purpose” of this crackdown is to “prevent banks from doing business with firms that have a ‘reputational risk’. The government tries to intimidate banks into keeping the reason for debanking a secret”.The Federal Reserve and the FDIC previously insisted there was no blanket ban on cryptocurrency companies in banking. “Banking organisations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation,” they said in 2023.Crypto ‘systematically involved in fraud’Still, US officials have aggressively pursued regulatory action against some of the biggest names in the digital currency space.In particular, US regulators ramped up their efforts in late 2022 the wake of the bankruptcy of FTX, which at one stage was valued at $32bn, and the crash of digital coin Terra Luna, which was at one point valued at $50bn. Both led to concerns that a major collapse could spread to the wider financial industry.Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder, was found guilty of stealing at least $10bn from the company’s customers and investors - Amr Alfiky/ReutersSupporters of this crackdown argue that regulators are justified in taking an intense interest in the crypto industry. Fears of scams, fraud, money-laundering and cyberattacks have never been far from cryptocurrency businesses.Carter Dougherty, of the non-profit group Americans for Financial Reform, says: “It is absolutely justified that banking regulators take a particularly jaundiced eye to the activities of cryptocurrency companies, precisely because they have been so systemically involved in fraud. This is a no-brainer. It shouldn’t be that controversial.“But you now have cryptocurrency lobbyists who are going to try and push for what in the end will be some kind of turning a blind eye to fraud.”Anger over the difficulties in accessing banking in the cryptocurrency industry are not limited to the US. In the UK, many high street banks block or flag cryptocurrency-related activity.In a report from the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking, MPs found “groups such as cryptocurrency businesses, jewellers, bookies, politicians, sex workers, yacht brokers and others are seen as problematic for banks”.It added: “Pretty much the entire banking industry has turned its back on the crypto industry. Even the industry trade body, CryptoUK, has found itself being refused banking facilities, not because it trades in cryptocurrencies in any way (the organisation only accepts membership fees in fiat currency) but because it has the word ‘crypto’ in its name.”Bivu Das, of Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, says: “To date, many UK traditional high street banks and popular neobanks [digital banks] have blocked or restricted their customers from depositing to crypto platforms, including FCA-registered ones like Kraken.“To be clear, this is a bank telling people how they can or can’t spend their money. We believe that is simply not right in 2024.”Still, data from Action Fraud suggest that £245m was lost to cryptocurrency scams in the UK in 2023 – a number that probably under-reports the true scale of the problem.In the US, Musk and his allies such as Andreessen are on the warpath. Musk, who is to lead a Trump commission on government efficiency, last week tweeted that he would “Delete CFPB (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)”, which has been criticised by crypto investors despite the fact the office has itself lobbied against debanking.The agency has been championed by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator who has attracted the ire of cryptocurrency enthusiasts for her scepticism about the industry.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator, is accused by the cryptocurrency industry of having an anti-crypto agenda - Tom WilliamsDougherty says the regulator has been routinely targeted by industries who “want to stop consumer protection authorities from doing their job of stopping people getting ripped off”.Even still, Berlau, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says the heavy-handed banking crackdown in the US has meant businesses that have tried to be on the right side of regulations have been unfairly targeted.“Industries are being painted with a broad brush, and individuals and businesses working in an industry that somehow offends the political elite get debanked.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

  "title": "Ransomware Gang Merciless Attacks Bleed Small Companies Dry",
  "content": " The black-and-white message flickering across computer screens sparked panic at Knights of Old, a 158-year-old UK delivery company: “If you’re reading this, it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead.” Knights’ network for managing trucks was down. So was the system for booking payments. From 2,000 miles away, a criminal, Russia-linked hacking gang known as Akira had sabotaged the computers at Knights of Old and two related trucking companies. To force negotiations, the crooks in June 2023 had deployed malicious software that encrypted Knights’ files and then threatened to publish online its confidential internal data. Paying a ransom would get the company a decryption key that could be used to unlock the compromised computers and servers, Akira said. “For now, let’s keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue,” the gang wrote in a note on Knights’ infected machines. “We’re fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources.” In 2023 ransomware attacks rose 70% from a year earlier, to 4,611, according to the SANS Institute, a cyber­security research and training organization. Since March 2023, Akira alone has victimized more than 350 organizations and extorted an estimated $42 million, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Bloomberg analysis found. (The gang, which maintains a website, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) Akira has had some high-profile targets, such as Nissan Motor Co., Stanford University and Yamaha Motor Co. But ­cybersecurity researchers have found that about 80% of its victims are small and medium-size organizations, most in North America and Europe. “No business can ignore this threat, no matter how big or small,” says Paul Abbott, 58, Knights’ co-owner. According to digital insurance company Embroker, most smaller businesses set their policy limits for cyber­security damages at $1 million, close to the level at Knights. That money could potentially be used to pay a ransom and help rebuild infected computers. But it’s often nowhere near enough. The median ransom payment soared to $6.5 million in 2023, from $335,000 the year before, insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. found. Will Thomas, a cybersecurity expert who’s closely tracked Akira’s attacks, says the group identifies its targets by scanning the internet for servers that are operating outdated software, then opportunistically breaches them. “What they do is not particularly complicated or sophisticated,” Thomas says. “But they are very successful, and they are ruthless.” In 1865, William Knight started making deliveries in a horse and cart he drove through an English village called Old, about 80 miles north of London. Hence his company, now based in nearby Kettering, would come to be known as Knights of Old. Abbott, who grew up in the area, knew the Knight family, and at age 20 he joined Knights of Old. He worked first as a traffic manager, helping to route the trucks and supporting drivers and customers. Abbott steadily climbed the ranks, and around 2007 he and two business partners, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, became directors and then co-­owners. They later joined Knights of Old with two other delivery ­companies—Nelson Distribution Ltd. and Steve Porter Transport Ltd.—under the name KNP Group.By the time of the hack, KNP had almost £100 million ($126 million) in annual revenue, 900 employees, seven depots and 400 trucks. Knights was the biggest and best known of the three companies, its trucks bearing an image of an armored knight and a vivid color scheme of bright blue with huge yellow letters spelling out the motto “Service With Honour.” Among its customers were publishing giants Penguin Random House LLC and Hachette Book Group, which relied on its fleet to distribute millions of books for Amazon.com Inc. and other retailers. In early 2023, KNP leased a 140,000-square-foot warehouse in Luton, near London, as part of an expansion effort. Having experienced computer failures in the past, Abbott and his colleagues had already established an alternative way of working. They could revert to writing out paper tickets and job sheets for each delivery and use their mobile phones and Gmail. Abbott had thought the company was secure. Just a month before the intrusion, he’d arranged a £1 million cyberattack policy through the British insurer Aviva Plc, which declined to comment. Managers had also trained staff on cybersecurity awareness and were paying about £60,000 annually to a contractor that provided support. But following the attack, he says, the contractor—whom he declines to name—provided little help and “didn’t have a clue” what to do. After the initial attack, Aviva arranged for a team of experts from security company Solace Cyber to help. The following morning it began to digitally clean all electronic devices—computers, laptops, even photocopiers—that were connected to the company’s network. Paul Cashmore, Solace’s managing director and co-founder, says the breach had inflicted devastating damage. He recalled navigating Knights’ employees through a roller coaster of emotions. “First there was the shock. Then it’s realization. Then it’s dealing with the impact,” he says. Solace is currently working on about two major ransom­ware incidents every week, Cashmore says, and the pace shows no sign of slowing. Knights consulted US-based company Coveware Inc., which specializes in negotiating with ransomware hackers, Abbott says. The company, which declined to comment, told him that, based on KNP’s size and revenue, the Akira gang would likely expect a payment in Bitcoin worth $2.7 million to $5.3 million. Law enforcement agencies generally advise against paying ransoms because it incentivizes further attacks. Sending cryptocurrency to the gangs could also violate sanctions that are in place against some of the criminals involved. Abbott said he and his partners decided not to negotiate with Akira or pay the gang anything, because there could be no guarantee the data could be fully recovered even with the decryption key. In response the hackers followed through on their threat, publishing more than 10,000 internal documents online—mostly employee payroll files, invoices and other financial information.The company tried to rebuild its computers. Within a few days, Knights’ technicians had set up a new transport management system and recovered an old backup of the warehouse software. But the financial management databases couldn’t be immediately recovered, because hackers had destroyed another backup that was supposed to be stored securely elsewhere. Facing cash-flow pressures, KNP sought a loan. Abbott says the bank would provide it only if the company could supply the missing financial records and performance reports. Still waiting on a payout from the insurance company, the ­co-owners tried to sell the company. A European businessman came close to buying. But, because of the missing financial records, the buyer insisted that the three partners personally guarantee the state of the company’s finances. They’d be putting their houses and savings on the line. The partners balked, according to Abbott. “My wife would never have let me do that, regardless of how confident we were in the business,” he says. On Sept. 25, 2023, KNP Group entered administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy. In Kettering, Abbott announced the news to his employees, some of whom he’d worked with for decades. Another company bought one of KNP’s subsidiaries, Nelson Distribution, saving about 170 jobs. But the rest of KNP’s 700 or so employees, the majority of them from Knights of Old, lost their livelihood. Jeff Maslin, who drove trucks for Knights, says drivers are still owed weeks’ worth of wages. “I know people who lost their house, lost their car and ended up divorced,” he says. KNP later determined that Akira had gained access to the company’s systems using a technique called “brute forcing,” which can employ software that makes thousands or millions of guesses to discover a staffer’s password. Abbott says more sophisticated security monitoring software might have helped detect the intrusion. “If you haven’t got that, get it,” he advises other companies. Earlier this year, administrators began the process of selling Knights’ headquarters, along with KNP’s other assets. The fleet of trucks, mostly leased, has been returned. The insurer eventually paid out on the £1 million policy, but it didn’t cover Knights’ losses in administration. Abbott, now working as a consultant for other logistics companies, recently bought a single truck and plans to use it to start over. “I’ve had to rebuild my life,” he says. “I’ve lost everything.” Photograph: Co-owner of Knights of Old Paul Abbott; photo credit: Ryan Gallagher/Bloomberg Copyright 2024 Bloomberg."

  "title": "Lonoke County officials push back on crypto project",
  "content": " Lonoke County elected officials are raising concerns about a cryptocurrency mining business planned for an area off Highway 67/167 near Cabot, a location they say will cause problems and is too close to the Little Rock Air Force Base. Last month, Lonoke County Judge Doug Erwin asked Interstate Holdings Blockchain to stop development of its planned cryptomining business in a cease-and-desist order that cited concerns over the site’s location in a floodplain. But at a Wednesday press conference at Cabot City Hall, county officials voiced bigger concerns. Cabot Mayor Ken Kincade, joined by Erwin and state Sen. Ricky Hill (R-Cabot), said he planned to fight the facility, according to a report from KATV:“These centers cause loud disturbances and pollution that produce negative effects on our people, pets, wild animals, nature, and overall wellbeing,” said Kincade. “We will not stand for this, and we will fight vehemently to address this company’s efforts. We will join with our neighbors in Lonoke County and our state senators, and representatives, and will do anything legally in our power to remove this from our community.”Earlier this week, Hill told KATV the crypto business was too close to the air force base and could be a threat to national security.“It’s not necessarily this facility itself, it’s what someone may do to hack into this facility to get information from our airbase,” Hill told KATV. A filing with the Arkansas secretary of state’s office says Interstate Holdings Blockchain was incorporated by Steve Landers Jr, the son of businessman and former Little Rock mayoral candidate Steve Landers. The company’s website lists the business’ team as including Curtis, Michael Shady, Zane Vergason and Steven “Tripp” Joe Landers III. Dustin Curtis, the company’s vice president, pushed back against the local officials’ concerns in an interview this week with Arkansas Money and Politics. Curtis said the facility meets requirements, has a lower noise level than the nearby highway and won’t be a drain on the power grid. Curtis also threw cold water on the argument about proximity to the air force base. From Arkansas Money and Politics:“If that’s the case, then every business within two miles of the air force base would have to abide by something, also, because any network or something that’s unsecure, if people can hack that, then they can hack anything, right?” he said. “This crypto mine is not going to be something that’s any different than another business.”Crypto mines in Arkansas have attracted attention in the past couple of years, thanks in part to a law passed by the state Legislature in 2023 that curtailed the ability of Arkansas cities and counties to regulate the industry. Crypto mining consists of nothing more than high-powered computers performing math problems — the process by which bitcoin confirms transactions and creates new bitcoin. The operations can result in big bucks for their owners, but detractors say the facilities consume too much electricity and water and cause too much noise, potentially lowering property values nearby. After blowback from residents of multiple communities, the Legislature changed the law earlier this year to allow for more local regulation, though the changes didn’t go far enough for some.Last month, a Facebook group called “Concerned Lonoke County Citizens” posted a picture of a letter from Dustin Curtis that it said had been received by several residents. The letter said the facility would be a “state of the art data center” and would meet the “highest industry standards.” Curtis said the facility would be efficient and reliable but would also prioritize environmental sustainability. Curtis also said the facility would follow all state and local laws and regulations and that it had taken steps to meet “all zoning, environmental and safety requirements.” The company’s website lists a “corporate office” in Sarasota, Florida, and a “central office” in Bryant. The site lists investments with Sun Valley Distillery of Idaho, cryptocurrency products, real estate and billboards. Last month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing a pair of state laws about foreign land ownership in a case involving an Arkansas County cryptocurrency mining operation.

  "content": " US stocks rose Friday after a report showed a healthy jobs market and Paris rallied as President Emmanuel Macron vowed to serve out his full term and end France's political crisis.Most other stock markets were pulled higher in their wake. But oil fell and Bitcoin pulled back under $100,000 after hitting records Thursday.The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, higher than analysts' expectations, and up from a revised 36,000 in October, said the Department of Labor.\"The US jobs market has emphatically rebounded following October's disappointing data,\" said Neal Keane, head of global sales trading at ADSS.October's figures had been depressed by hurricanes and a dockworkers strike, and November's increases may have been exaggerated by the end of a strike at Boeing and by retail hiring ahead of the holiday season.US stock futures jumped in pre-market trading after the report, but gave back some of those gains.Investors are mostly betting that November's numbers, while comforting, are probably not strong enough to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again later this month.\"Investors needed a reassuring jobs report and that's exactly what they got,\" said eToro analyst Bret Kenwell. \"The market still favors a rate cut from the Fed later this month and this report may not change that expectation.\"- Paris markets rise after Macron speech -The Paris stock market was up 1.4 percent in mid-afternoon trading, on \"hope that President Emmanuel Macron will serve out his term and that a (French) budget can be passed in the coming weeks\", noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Macron on Friday was holding talks with French political leaders on the left and right as he seeks to quickly name a new prime minister after Michel Barnier's government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote.Macron adopted a defiant tone in an address to the nation Thursday evening, just 24 hours after parliament voted out Barnier over his 2025 budget plan, which included unpopular austerity measures forced through without a vote, using special powers.The luxury sector benefitted also from hopes of a pickup in Chinese demand. Gucci owner Kering topped the Paris CAC 40 as its shares gained more than five percent, while LVMH rose more than 3 percent.Frankfurt and other continental markets were also higher, though not by as much, and London little changed. In Asia, shares in Seoul sank more than one percent and the won weakened to about 1,420 per dollar as lawmakers prepared to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol's dramatic, short-lived martial law this week.While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing.On Friday the head of Yoon's ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country.Hong Kong and Shanghai rallied as investors grew hopeful of fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week.That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that China's near two-year growth slowdown could soon end.Bitcoin was hovering around $98,000, after having blasted to the historic peak of $103,800 Thursday on news that US President-elect Donald Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to head the nation's markets regulator.Oil prices slipped as OPEC+'s decision to extend supply cuts failed to assuage concerns about coming excess supply.\"Concerns about oversupply and muted global growth remain at the forefront\" of the energy market, said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at City Index. - Key figures around 1435 GMT -New York - Dow: UP 0.2 percent at 44,857.71 pointsNew York - S&P 500: UP 0.3 percent at 6,092.33 New York - Nasdaq Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 19,766.54Paris - CAC 40: UP 1.4 percent at 7,432.86Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.2 percent at 20,403.74London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 8,340.34 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.8 percent at 39,091.17 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.6 percent at 19,865.85 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.1 percent at 3,404.08 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0583 from $1.0591 on ThursdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2772 from $1.2760Dollar/yen: DOWN at 149.44 yen from 150.09 yen Euro/pound: DOWN at 82.89 from 82.97 penceWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.1 percent at $67.55 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 1.0 percent at $71.36 per barrelgv/jj "

  "content": " December 6, 2024 (Investorideas.com Newswire) S&P 500 pushed for new ATHs early in the session, but was rejected, and premarket session is shallow and cautious - why deploy fresh money before NFPs? No reason to, yet there are distinct signs offered by the bond market and yields overall with respect to where equities are going. VIX continues being tame, and that's perfectly in line with my call for a slow grind higher, yet tame as befits Presidential election years' Santa Claus track record. Note also my publicly expressed misgivings about oil price, and a fresh update meriting attention of precious metals investors and traders follows in the premium section too. Final question of this opening part is when Bitcoin will overcome and close above $100K - key determinant.

  "title": "Stock market today : Wall Street nears records as jobs data keeps hope alive for a coming rate cut",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.

Today's top stories Syrian opposition forces stormed Hama city in central Syria yesterday as part of their largest offensive in years against President Bashar al-Assad's government. The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Omar Albam / AP / APSmoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing. Life advice Malaka Gharib/ NPR / It is the season for giving, but not everyone has a knack for finding the right gift for their loved ones.

  "content": " Bitcoin price hovers around $98,000 at the end of a week in which it surpassed the $100K milestone to correct sharply afterward. BTC institutional demand and whale accumulation remain strong, supporting Bitcoin’s rally. Traders should be cautious due to the move of funds from Mt.Gox, US government transfers, and holders booking profits. Bitcoin (BTC) ends the working week hovering around $98,000 after a very volatile Thursday when it surpassed the $100K milestone and underwent a sharp correction. Strong institutional demand, whale accumulation, and the choice of a pro-crypto figure to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fueled the rally this week. However, traders should be cautious about a possible correction ahead as on-chain data shows holders booking profits at the top. Moreover, any moves from Mt.Gox funds and US government transfers could add to the selling pressure. Bitcoin institutional demand, whale accumulation remain strong Bitcoin surged past the $100K milestone on Thursday, reaching a peak of $104,088 before experiencing a sharp drop to $90,500. It ultimately recovered to close above $96,900. As of Friday, it is trading slightly above $98,000. This week, institutional demand supported Bitcoin’s rally. According to Coinglass, Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) data saw an inflow totaling $2.4 billion until Thursday, compared to a $136.5 million outflow last week. If this inflow trend persists or accelerates, it could provide additional momentum to the ongoing Bitcoin price rally. Total Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflow chart. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings has added more BTC this week. According to data from the crypto intelligence tracker Arkham, MARA holdings increased from 17,000 BTC on Monday to 22,000 BTC on Friday, bringing its total holding to an amount worth $2.17 billion. The potential incorporation of Bitcoin as a reserve asset by firms like MARA is good news for Bitcoin as it shows increasing adoption from big players. MARA BTC holdings chart. Source: Arkham As Bitcoin dropped from $100K on Thursday, a whale seized the opportunity and bought 600 BTC worth $58.85 million, according to Lookonchain data. Over the past two weeks, this whale has accumulated 1,300 BTC, worth $127 million. More optimistic signs for Bitcoin Multiple optimistic news and events have supported BTC’s rise towards the $100K milestone this week. Starting with Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, who delivered a presentation to Microsoft’s board on why the tech giant should buy Bitcoin. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor said. Microsoft’s shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to add BTC to its balance sheet on December 10, according to a report from QCP Capital. “If the proposal passes, it would be bullish not only for BTC but also for their other investments,” the report notes. Wednesday’s announcement of who would be the new chair of the US SEC added more bullish momentum to Bitcoin. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that he had nominated Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners, to take the role. This announcement positively impacted the market as Atkins is considered pro-crypto. On the same day, Bitcoin also got the endorsement of another prominent figure: Vladimir Putin. “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody. And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody,” the Russian President said on Wednesday at an investment forum in Moscow, according to a Watcher.Guru Twitter post. Some bearish signs to watch for After BTC rallied above the $100K mark this week, the COO of Bitget Wallet, Alvin Kan, told FXStreet that he expects a “healthy correction” shortly. “As market volatility could continue to increase, users should be cautious about leverage in futures contracts to avoid liquidation risks from sudden downturns. After the correction, it’s important to focus on sector rotation, as altcoin seasons are likely to continue,” Kan said. Profit-taking is another short-term risk for Bitcoin price after the recent rally. Santiment’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator suggests holders book profits at the top. BTC’s NPL metric spiked on Thursday, indicating that holders are, on average, selling their bags at a significant profit. A similar spike was seen on November 21, which led to a correction of over 7% in the next five days. If history repeats, BTC could see a similar fall in the short term. BTC NPL chart. Source: Santiment According to data from crypto intelligence tracker Arkham, a wallet related to the US government, moved on Monday 10K BTC worth $962.88 million from the Silk Road seized address to Coinbase Prime. On Tuesday, the US government wallet carried out a similar move, which moved many altcoins like Ethereum, Compound, Axie Infinity, and others worth $33.59 million into new wallets. Moreover, as BTC prices rose to six figures on Thursday, defunct exchange Mt.Gox transferred 24,052 BTC worth $2.43 billion to a new wallet, according to Lookonchain data. Similarly, on Friday, the Mt. Gox wallet transferred 3,620 BTC worth $352.69 million to two new wallets. If any of the above wallets intend to sell or distribute these coins, they can create bearish sentiment as market participants anticipate increased supply. Technical outlook: BTC rise toward $120K or a drop to $85K? Bitcoin price broke above the $100K milestone, reaching a high of $104,088, then fell sharply to make a daily low of $90,500 but recovered and closed above $96,900 on Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers around $98,000. Despite the recovery from Thursday’s fall, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) flashes warning signs. The higher high formed on Thursday does not reflect the RSI chart for the same period, indicating a formation of a bearish divergence, which often leads to a short-term correction. If this bearish divergence plays out, traders could expect a small rise towards the recent high of $104,088 (grabbing liquidity or trapping longs), to then fall sharply towards the $90,000 support level. A successful close below this level could extend an additional decline towards the next support level of $85,000. BTC/USDT daily chart Conversely, if BTC continues its uptrend and closes above $104,088, it could extend the rally towards the new all-time high of $119,510, a level that aligns with the 141.4% Fibonacci extension line drawn from the November 4 low of $66,835 to Thursday’s all-time high of $104,088. Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

  "title": "Bitcoin Reserve Would  Benefit Special Interest Groups , Former Fed Chairman Warns",
  "content": "Former chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bill Dudley on Friday voiced strong concerns over the United States potentially including Bitcoin BTC/USD in its national reserves, a proposal gaining momentum among crypto-friendly legislators. In an opinion piece, Dudley argues that such a move could harm the interests of the general public and compromise the dollar’s standing as the global reserve currency. He highlighted the potential downsides of establishing a government Bitcoin reserve, stating, “If the United States adopts Bitcoin as a reserve asset, it would likely benefit specific interest groups at the expense of the majority.” He also warned that such a strategy would be more about inflating Bitcoin’s value than delivering any tangible benefit to the government or citizens. Bitcoin, which recently surged past $100,000 following Donald Trump‘s election victory, is seen by some as a revolutionary asset. Proponents believe it could serve as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool in portfolios. However, Dudley criticized its role as money, describing its volatility and lack of income generation as fundamental flaws. “Bitcoin is not connected to any cash flows like interest or dividends, and its price is driven purely by speculative demand,” he explained. Also Read: Semler Scientific Expands Bitcoin Holdings To Over $180 Million With Latest Purchase Dudley pointed out the dangers of the U.S. government holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin and said if the Treasury borrows to fund Bitcoin purchases, it would drive up debt service costs. “Alternatively, if the Federal Reserve creates money for the same purpose, it risks fueling inflation,” he said, adding that these outcomes would negatively impact taxpayers and the broader economy. The former Fed chair also noted that the absence of an exit strategy for a Bitcoin reserve would make it a liability. “The government would end up holding tokens that produce no income, offering no real value to the majority of Americans,” he said. Instead of focusing on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Dudley called for the Trump administration to prioritize creating a robust regulatory framework for the crypto industry. He emphasized the need for clear rules to protect consumers, regulate stablecoins, and prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. “Crypto technology has the potential to improve the financial system,” Dudley said. “However, without strong guardrails, fraud and abuse will continue to undermine trust and hinder progress.” Read Next: Dave Portnoy Blames Winklevoss Twins For Confusing Him Into Selling Bitcoin Too Early Image: Shutterstock Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

  "title": "Baystreet . ca - Trump Names Venture Capitalist David Sacks U . S .  Crypto Czar  ",
  "content": " U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has named venture capitalist and podcast host David Sacks to be the country’s new “Crypto Czar.” On social media, Trump said that Sacks will join his White House administration in the newly created role of “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” This means that Sacks will spearhead the Trump administration’s policies for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. One of Sacks first tasks will reportedly be to create a legal framework for crypto such as Bitcoin (BTC), as well as leading a presidential council of advisors on science and technology. Sacks was a major Trump supporter during the U.S. election campaign, hosting a fundraiser at his San Francisco mansion that charged $50,000 U.S. per person to attend. However, Sacks has been critical of Trump in the past, notably after the Capitol Hill riot in January 2021. Sacks said on his “All-In” podcast that Trump was “clearly” responsible for the events of January 6, and that he had “disqualified himself from being a candidate at a national level.” However, by this summer, Sacks was speaking at the Republican National Convention and raising money to get Trump re-elected. Besides his podcast, Sacks is a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who sold Yammer to Microsoft (MSFT) for $1.2 billion U.S. back in 2012. He’s also a member of the so called “PayPal mafia,” a group of prominent technology figures, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who founded and grew PayPal (PYPL) in the 1990s. The price of Bitcoin has pulled back to trade at $98,000 U.S. after rising to a record high of $103,000 U.S. in recent days. "

  "title": "Hawk Tuah girl : Online star faces crypto coin criticism",
  "content": "Haliey Welch, known mostly as the star of the viral \"Hawk Tuah\" meme, is facing criticism after her newly launched cryptocurrency nosedived in value.Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X , external(formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.She added that no \"KOL\" (key opinion leaders) were gifted a free token.Ms Welch had previously distributed free Hawk tokens to some fans ahead of the launch across social media.Hawk launched on the Solana blockchain at around 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, and its market capitalisation soared to highs of $490m shortly after.However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.A community note on Ms Welch's X post contests her explanation, saying her team had been selling their Hawk coins since launch.Coffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, also claimed that Hawk gave \"insiders\" an advantage.\"Unfortunately with situations like this, they're not targeting crypto bros, they're mostly targeting actual fans who have never been involved in the crypto space before,\" he said in a video viewed more than 1.4 million times.He accused Ms Welch's team of \"profiting from a rug pull\". \"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.Ms Welch's post on X claimed that her team attempted to prevent so-called \"snipers\", who buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly at moments when they are likely to make the most money from a gap in buy and sell price - sometimes using automated trading tools - by imposing higher fees on one exchange.The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post, external. It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.More recently, YouTuber Logan Paul was accused of misleading fans by promoting crypto coins or investments without divulging his own financial interest in them.Known online as the \"Hawk Tuah girl\", Ms Welch went viral after speaking the onomatopoeia \"hawk tuah\" - imitating the sound of someone spitting - during an interview in June.It made the 22-year-old, from Belfast, Tennessee, an overnight internet sensation. She amassed hundreds of thousands of followers across various social platforms and launched her own merchandise and a podcast called \"Talk Tuah\".Her manager told the Hollywood Reporter in July, external that she was unique in not having sought out internet fame, having been off social media for mental health reasons for several months before appearing in the now-viral \"Hawk Tuah\" video. Rolling Stone has likened her funny, small-town personality to a \"Gen Z Dolly Parton\".

  "title": "Bitcoin drops below $100 , 000 after reaching milestone for 1st time",
  "content": " Fernando Gutierrez-Juarez/picture alliance via Getty Images(NEW YORK) -- The price of bitcoin dropped below $100,000 late Thursday, just a day after topping the milestone for the first time.The world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to slide in early trading on Friday, before recovering some of the losses.The turmoil for bitcoin did not appear to impact other major crypto coins. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed nearly 5% in early trading on Friday, exceeding $4,000 for the first time since March.The turn of fortune for bitcoin interrupted a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump, who is viewed as friendly toward cryptocurrency.Since Election Day, the price of bitcoin has climbed nearly 50%. That performance far outpaces the S&P 500, which has risen about 5% over the same period.Bitcoin has proven highly volatile since its launch about 15 years ago.As recently as 2021, bitcoin suffered a downturn that cut its value in half. The same thing happened a year earlier, when the initial outset of the pandemic triggered a panic among investors.“As long as the narrative stays positive, there’s always room to grow,” Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, told ABC News before bitcoin reached $100,000.“It’s still a highly volatile asset,” Armour added.A surge had propelled bitcoin past $100,000 late Wednesday, just hours after Trump nominated crypto booster Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, the CEO of consulting firm Patomak Partners, serves as co-chair of the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.Once a crypto critic, Trump has vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump has also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.In a post on Truth Social early Thursday, Trump took credit for the gains: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!.”Trump has not spoken publicly about bitcoin since it fell below $100,000.Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved. "

  "title": "Tech billionaires at war with Biden as debanking row goes stateside",
  "content": "When Coutts threatened to close the bank account of Nigel Farage last year, the fallout claimed the scalp of one of Britain’s most senior banking executives and triggered a national debate over “debanking”.Was it really acceptable for a bank to close the accounts of customers seemingly without warning, explanation or recourse? And were the decisions motivated by politics?Now, anger over debanking is picking up steam across the Atlantic. Technology billionaires, many of whom supported Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, accuse the Biden administration of cutting them off from the US banking system.Executives, primarily drawn from the cryptocurrency industry, have railed against what they have dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” – an alleged government effort to smother their businesses by making it almost impossible to maintain a formal banking presence.“This is one of the reasons we ended up supporting Trump,” Marc Andreessen, the billionaire co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, told the podcaster Joe Rogan last week. “We’ve had, like, 30 founders debanked in the last four years.”Over the last week, these claims have been amplified by billionaire Trump supporters, including Elon Musk, as well as dozens of cryptocurrency and tech founders. They allege they have been cut off from the US banking system by the Biden administration and government watchdogs.David Marcus, a former Facebook executive who led the tech giant’s Libra digital currency project, claimed its plans were “killed” by top government officials, including Janet Yellen, Biden’s Treasury Secretary. “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100pc a political kill,” he claimed in a post on X.Target political opponentsThe alleged debanking of crypto entrepreneurs comes amid a years-long crackdown on digital currency business and their billionaire founders. Under the Biden administration, US regulators have unleashed a series of civil and criminal lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges.Those prosecuting such cases claim they are simply enforcing regulation or crackdown on wrongdoing.Yet critics claim it is part of a broader effort to target political opponents. Andreessen claimed that it is not only businesses that have been impacted, but “just generally political opponents”.In her book, Melania Trump, the former first lady, claimed her bank account and that of her son Barron were shut down in the wake of the Jan 6 riots. “This decision appeared to be rooted in political discrimination,” she wrote.Melania and Barron claimed her, and her son’s Barron, bank accounts were shut down in the wake of the Jan 6 riots - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North AmericaFarage’s fury toppled Alison Rose, Britain’s most senior female banker and the ultimate boss of Coutts, in a victory for the Reform UK leader.However, US cryptocurrency executives claim their anger has been channelled towards even more powerful ends: winning the White House.In the technology industry, the crackdown has prompted many billionaire cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to become funders of the Republican Party’s election efforts.Crypto donors spent $245m (£192m) backing pro-cryptocurrency candidates, largely Republicans. One crypto-funded political action committee spent $40m alone to defeat Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator for Ohio.Trump has seemingly repaid the industry for their support, naming Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency lobbyist, as his nominee to chair the US Security and Exchange Commission.On Thursday, Trump claimed responsibility for helping to drive a surge in the price of Bitcoin to $100,000, posting “You’re welcome” to his followers on Truth Social.Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, the $80bn cryptocurrency trading app, said in a post on X the crackdown on cryptocurrency companies was one of the most “un-American things that happened in the Biden administration” and “a major factor in the Dems losing the election”.Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech lobbying group Chamber of Progress, says: “I’ve heard directly from crypto-founders at conferences and round tables who view ‘debanking’ as a key driver of their political advocacy.“Many in the industry see this issue as a motivating factor behind their support for incoming president Donald Trump, hoping his administration can reset regulatory relations with the crypto and blockchain sectors.”Andreessen, whose venture firm is an investor in Coinbase, and others have compared “Operation Choke Point 2.0” to a previous Obama-era scandal known as “Operation Choke Point”. This involved US justice officials pushing banks to close accounts used by legal – if politically controversial – customers, such as sex workers, gun dealers or legal marijuana shops.After Trump’s victory in 2016, the programme was shut down. But the cryptocurrency industry believes the initiative was reheated on Biden’s watch, in what Armstrong called an attempt to “unlawfully kill our entire industry”.In June, Coinbase hired a research firm to sue the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the US banking agency, accusing it of having “pressured financial institutions to cut off the industry from the banking system”.It has accused the regulator of sending so-called “pause letters” to banks, ordering them to halt crypto related activity indefinitely. After its efforts to reveal these documents using Freedom of Information laws were blocked, the regulator was sued.The lawsuit claims: “It is illegal for financial regulators to coerce regulated institutions in secret to cut ties with businesses the government disfavours.”John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says the “supposed purpose” of this crackdown is to “prevent banks from doing business with firms that have a ‘reputational risk’. The government tries to intimidate banks into keeping the reason for debanking a secret”.The Federal Reserve and the FDIC previously insisted there was no blanket ban on cryptocurrency companies in banking. “Banking organisations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation,” they said in 2023.Crypto ‘systematically involved in fraud’Still, US officials have aggressively pursued regulatory action against some of the biggest names in the digital currency space.In particular, US regulators ramped up their efforts in late 2022 the wake of the bankruptcy of FTX, which at one stage was valued at $32bn, and the crash of digital coin Terra Luna, which was at one point valued at $50bn. Both led to concerns that a major collapse could spread to the wider financial industry.Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder, was found guilty of stealing at least $10bn from the company’s customers and investors - Amr Alfiky/ReutersSupporters of this crackdown argue that regulators are justified in taking an intense interest in the crypto industry. Fears of scams, fraud, money-laundering and cyberattacks have never been far from cryptocurrency businesses.Carter Dougherty, of the non-profit group Americans for Financial Reform, says: “It is absolutely justified that banking regulators take a particularly jaundiced eye to the activities of cryptocurrency companies, precisely because they have been so systemically involved in fraud. This is a no-brainer. It shouldn’t be that controversial.“But you now have cryptocurrency lobbyists who are going to try and push for what in the end will be some kind of turning a blind eye to fraud.”Anger over the difficulties in accessing banking in the cryptocurrency industry are not limited to the US. In the UK, many high street banks block or flag cryptocurrency-related activity.In a report from the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking, MPs found “groups such as cryptocurrency businesses, jewellers, bookies, politicians, sex workers, yacht brokers and others are seen as problematic for banks”.It added: “Pretty much the entire banking industry has turned its back on the crypto industry. Even the industry trade body, CryptoUK, has found itself being refused banking facilities, not because it trades in cryptocurrencies in any way (the organisation only accepts membership fees in fiat currency) but because it has the word ‘crypto’ in its name.”Bivu Das, of Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, says: “To date, many UK traditional high street banks and popular neobanks [digital banks] have blocked or restricted their customers from depositing to crypto platforms, including FCA-registered ones like Kraken.“To be clear, this is a bank telling people how they can or can’t spend their money. We believe that is simply not right in 2024.”Still, data from Action Fraud suggest that £245m was lost to cryptocurrency scams in the UK in 2023 – a number that probably under-reports the true scale of the problem.In the US, Musk and his allies such as Andreessen are on the warpath. Musk, who is to lead a Trump commission on government efficiency, last week tweeted that he would “Delete CFPB (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)”, which has been criticised by crypto investors despite the fact the office has itself lobbied against debanking.The agency has been championed by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator who has attracted the ire of cryptocurrency enthusiasts for her scepticism about the industry.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator, is accused by the cryptocurrency industry of having an anti-crypto agenda - Tom WilliamsDougherty says the regulator has been routinely targeted by industries who “want to stop consumer protection authorities from doing their job of stopping people getting ripped off”.Even still, Berlau, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says the heavy-handed banking crackdown in the US has meant businesses that have tried to be on the right side of regulations have been unfairly targeted.“Industries are being painted with a broad brush, and individuals and businesses working in an industry that somehow offends the political elite get debanked.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

  "content": " US stocks rose Friday after a report showed a healthy jobs market and Paris rallied as President Emmanuel Macron vowed to serve out his full term and end France's political crisis.Most other stock markets were pulled higher in their wake. But oil fell and Bitcoin pulled back under $100,000 after hitting records Thursday.The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, higher than analysts' expectations, and up from a revised 36,000 in October, said the Department of Labor.\"The US jobs market has emphatically rebounded following October's disappointing data,\" said Neal Keane, head of global sales trading at ADSS.October's figures had been depressed by hurricanes and a dockworkers strike, and November's increases may have been exaggerated by the end of a strike at Boeing and by retail hiring ahead of the holiday season.US stock futures jumped in pre-market trading after the report, but gave back some of those gains.Investors are mostly betting that November's numbers, while comforting, are probably not strong enough to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again later this month.\"Investors needed a reassuring jobs report and that's exactly what they got,\" said eToro analyst Bret Kenwell. \"The market still favors a rate cut from the Fed later this month and this report may not change that expectation.\"- Paris markets rise after Macron speech -The Paris stock market was up 1.4 percent in mid-afternoon trading, on \"hope that President Emmanuel Macron will serve out his term and that a (French) budget can be passed in the coming weeks\", noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Macron on Friday was holding talks with French political leaders on the left and right as he seeks to quickly name a new prime minister after Michel Barnier's government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote.Macron adopted a defiant tone in an address to the nation Thursday evening, just 24 hours after parliament voted out Barnier over his 2025 budget plan, which included unpopular austerity measures forced through without a vote, using special powers.The luxury sector benefitted also from hopes of a pickup in Chinese demand. Gucci owner Kering topped the Paris CAC 40 as its shares gained more than five percent, while LVMH rose more than 3 percent.Frankfurt and other continental markets were also higher, though not by as much, and London little changed. In Asia, shares in Seoul sank more than one percent and the won weakened to about 1,420 per dollar as lawmakers prepared to hold an impeachment vote Saturday after President Yoon Suk Yeol's dramatic, short-lived martial law this week.While analysts said the economic fallout from the crisis would likely be limited, the political storm is ongoing.On Friday the head of Yoon's ruling People Power Party demanded he stand down over the incident, warning he posed a great danger to the country.Hong Kong and Shanghai rallied as investors grew hopeful of fresh stimulus when top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping meet to discuss economic policy next week.That gathering follows recent data that gave a glimmer of optimism that China's near two-year growth slowdown could soon end.Bitcoin was hovering around $98,000, after having blasted to the historic peak of $103,800 Thursday on news that US President-elect Donald Trump had picked crypto proponent Paul Atkins to head the nation's markets regulator.Oil prices slipped as OPEC+'s decision to extend supply cuts failed to assuage concerns about coming excess supply.\"Concerns about oversupply and muted global growth remain at the forefront\" of the energy market, said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at City Index. - Key figures around 1435 GMT -New York - Dow: UP 0.2 percent at 44,857.71 pointsNew York - S&P 500: UP 0.3 percent at 6,092.33 New York - Nasdaq Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 19,766.54Paris - CAC 40: UP 1.4 percent at 7,432.86Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.2 percent at 20,403.74London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 8,340.34 Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.8 percent at 39,091.17 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.6 percent at 19,865.85 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.1 percent at 3,404.08 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0583 from $1.0591 on ThursdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2772 from $1.2760Dollar/yen: DOWN at 149.44 yen from 150.09 yen Euro/pound: DOWN at 82.89 from 82.97 penceWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.1 percent at $67.55 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: DOWN 1.0 percent at $71.36 per barrelgv/jj "

  "content": " December 6, 2024 (Investorideas.com Newswire) S&P 500 pushed for new ATHs early in the session, but was rejected, and premarket session is shallow and cautious - why deploy fresh money before NFPs?

Today's top stories Syrian opposition forces stormed Hama city in central Syria yesterday as part of their largest offensive in years against President Bashar al-Assad's government. The rebel push started last week when fighting led to the capture of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo. Omar Albam / AP / APSmoke from fighting billows in the edges of the town of Hama, Syria, Tuesday Dec. 3, 2024. 🎧 More than 100 civilians have died from the fighting between the rebel forces and pro-government factions, which are backed by Russia and Iran, NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi tells Up First. Hama has regional significance as it's a main supply route that Iran uses to move weapons to its ally — the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. HTS, which used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, is leading the offensive. Eyes are on the next big city — Homs, where fighting on the outskirts has been reported. If the rebels keep the momentum going, they'll be inching closer to the Syrian government's seat of power. President-elect Donald Trump announced David Sacks will take on the role of the White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks, a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist, would guide the administration's policies toward these technologies. The decision comes after Bitcoin hit $100,000 this week for the first time. 🎧 Trump has promised to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and to nominate regulators friendly to that industry, NPR's Rafael Nam says. This is a very different approach from the Biden administration. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Critics like Dennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets are concerned the latest rally around crypto could create a short-term boom over the next couple of years but could lead to a catastrophic financial crisis. Officials in New York City are taking steps toward addressing its housing crisis by approving a housing plan called City of Yes. It could lead to 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years. The city has over 3.5 million homes, but most are occupied, and prices outpace those in nearly every other location in the U.S. 🎧 The plan has tweaks that will permit more housing: Some homeowners will be allowed to add an extra unit on their properties, and developers can build bigger buildings near subway stations, according to David Brand of WNYC, an NPR network station. The plan will also make it easier to convert offices into apartments and condos. Though significant, the plan won't solve the city's housing problems, especially for the lowest-income New Yorkers. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says zoning alone doesn't create affordable housing, which is why she got the mayor to commit more funding for rent aid and low-income housing. Life advice Malaka Gharib/ NPR / It is the season for giving, but not everyone has a knack for finding the right gift for their loved ones.

Homemade gifts are also great options. 🎁 For those who enjoy experiences, consider activity-related gifts like cookbooks, Lego sets or even a membership to a local museum. 🎁 Gifts that encourage relaxation and destressing, like massage guns and blankets, are perfect for the cozy person. 🎁 What about the person who has it all? Give them something totally fun, totally unexpected and heartfelt. Get more gift ideas for these five personality types here.

  "title": "Stock market today : Wall Street nears records as jobs data keeps hope alive for a coming rate cut",
  "content": " NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are ticking higher Friday after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not so strong that it raises immediate worries about inflation.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and was just above its all-time high set on Wednesday. It’s rolling toward the close of a third straight winning week in what’s likely to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 31 points higher, or 0.1%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6%.Stocks rose as the latest jobs report sent Treasury yields down and expectations up among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. While the report showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, it also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.“This print doesn’t kill the holiday spirit and the Fed remains on track to deliver a cut in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 56 times so far this year. And the Fed is part of a global surge: 62 central banks have lowered rates in the past three months, the most since 2020, according to Michael Hartnett and other strategists at Bank of America.Still, the jobs report may have included some notes of caution for Fed officials underneath the surface.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, pointed to average wages for workers last month, which were a touch stronger than economists expected. While that’s good news for workers who would always like to make more, it could also keep upward pressure on inflation.“This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as sticky housing/shelter/wage data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” Wren said.So, while traders are betting on a 90% probability the Fed will ease its main rate in two weeks, they’re much less certain about how many more cuts it will deliver next year, according to data from CME Group.For now, the hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates so swiftly to crush inflation.Several retailers offered encouragement after delivering better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Ulta Beauty rallied 11.8% after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. The opening of new stores helped it boost its revenue, and it raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for sales over this full year.Lululemon stretched 15.8% higher following its own profit report. It said stronger sales outside the United States helped it in particular, and its earnings topped analysts’ expectations.Retailers overall have been offering mixed signals on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain amid the slowing job market and still-high prices. Target reported sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season, for example. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more in December than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of any possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 9.7% for one of the S&P 500's larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stock broadly were one of the main reasons for the S&P 500's climb this past week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.13% from 4.18% late Thursday.In stock markets abroad, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.2% after French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. It came after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his cabinet to resign.In Asia, stock indexes were mixed. They rallied 1.6% in Hong Kong and 1% in Shanghai ahead of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week.South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% as South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and may be impeached.Bitcoin was sitting around $99,000 after briefly bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before.AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.
